Normally, I reviews establishment unless rating exceptionally great exceptionally bad. If I felt sucker punched mugged I left Mr. Hoagie, I would writing bad review. On first last trip there, I paid $24.59 two whole hoagies. 1) The Italian (ordered woman (she) working told popular hoagie) I ordered lettuce onions (no tomato, italian dressing come free hoagie). I pay $1 add cheese hoagie. Because I traveling would eating hoagie right away, I asked italian side. She told charge dressing side. I passed principle. Are kidding me? I saved money declining tomato. I going pay dressing side. At point, I certain something right place appears financial trouble. That pales comparison happened next. I opened hoagie three microscopically thin slices meat hoagie. Ham, salami, bologna. Bologna!?!?!?!? Who hell puts disgusting bologna Italian hoagie? That disqualifies hoagie Italian. The red flags indicating place financial trouble blinding view. One area hoagie one slice bologna, ham salami. 2) The Steak hoagie came nothing lettuce, tomato, onions, dressing. I ordered without lettuce, tomato, onions, dressing. I asked mayo side. I pay I declined. Are kidding me? I saved money passing lettuce, tomato, fresh onions, dressing! I paid $3 add sautéed mushrooms, onions, cheese. Here go again. Canned mushrooms even cooked (were still cold) onions still crunchy/undercooked. News flash: need serve fresh mushrooms sautéed (canned mushrooms another sign place financial trouble). I literally open hoagie find steak I could taste see it. The hoagie 50% mushrooms, 30%onions, 10% cheese 10% steak. I could personally made 10 whole hoagies substantial quality ingredients toppings $24.59 I paid two whole hoagies. I intentionally patronize non-chain restaurants support small businesses. In case, Never. Again. (The hoagie bun better average.) Wake going lose business.
I like place lot. It's good toasted hoagie. I actually don't like bun exploding meat, previous poster mentioned maybe wouldn't like place. The inside badly needs updated though. The staff friendly.
This place absolute garbage... Half tees available, including grass tees. It cash only, sell last bucket 8, despite lights. And finish even minute 8, don't plan getting drink. The vending machines sold (of course) sell drinks inside, close drawers 8 dot. There weeds grown place. I noticed sort batting cage, looks like order well. Someone buy place turn be.
I remember old man 20 years ago eating giant size hamburger used asked questions I miss days food spectacular fish die four never put schedule things I promise won't sorry.
Very disappointed customer service. We ordered Reuben's wanted coleslaw instead kraut. They charged us $3.00 coleslaw. We back . The iced tea also terrible tasting.
Dont waste time place. Long lines, overpriced shade cooling spots wait. Half "rides" shut down. You're better garden hose. Save money buddy someone pool.
We went Sandcastle Waterpark past weekend went Heinz Field. We family four; Dad, Mom, 17 year old girl, 8 year old girl. We enjoyed it. There plenty everyone; wave pool, kiddie pools, single tube slides, double tube slides, body slides. It cloudy day upper 70's, wasn't crowded all. Check coupons Giant, Local Flavor, places. Some things don't open 12 PM, even park opens 11 AM. Parking $6.00.
I season pass go atleast week time I've last week Ive been.disappointed. Two weeks ago threw rubber baby wave pool entice panic claimed iy training exercise. Disgusted. And today twice pool mushroom waterfall shut due adults pooping pool puking dont know cant get strait answer employees. Just sad customer service sucks.
This first time back 12 years. I haven't since high school hard compare 12 years ago now. I know prices gone remember paying $19. I think best thing purchase tickets giant eagle even looking sandcastle website deals. My sister deal 19.99 day 2015 season. I paid 26.99 local giant eagle. Thats really big deal. I definetly shocked $6 $12 fee park.. I mean ridiculous pay pay get another fee park crazy. We opted $12 fee park real close entrance bc 7 year old us. It worth extra $6. I learned get line game fairly early want good spot pool... People plow run get prime spot. That downfall. Plus means lot RUDE PEOPLE. We got early enough ride rides needed too. didn't lay river however lines RIDICULOUS. The wave pool hit son watch people there. People rude well. Some horse play such. I must comment food, def love potato patch fries prices crazy... I ordered 2 chicken tender meals fries costed around 35 drinks. THATS BS. Sandcastle ok place visit, worth money
Insanely expensive! $6 parking. $8 locker. $9 wrinkled, burnt hot dog. I really hate place. Kids received season passes Christmas present. Brought kids never return. Spent $46 food threw away
This 4th year season pass holder. Each year park seems go downhill little. I yesterday bathroom wave pool deplorable. I hate people leave bathroom disgusting Sandcastle needs better job keeping clean. Yesterday people park keeping bathrooms clean easier. The issue I yesterday young lady late teens/early 20's wear black bikini. The bottoms modified thing. (Modified meaning smidge wider whale's tail thong.). It NOT appropriate all. My family sitting wave pool area saw young lady multiple times. Two times female leader/manager standing there. She watched girl made comments workers never said anything girl. The Lifeguards nice good job. The employees food stations also nice service quick. Our family big fan Chic Fil A love there. The park needs tweak things get 4 5 stars. Keeping restrooms clean updating chairs loungers would steps right direction.
This water park alright. Definitely outdated needs work way get house hot summer day. Staff friendly lifeguards alert. Prices little steep water park around get away it.
I'm mattress buying novice. I also hate buying things require try-before-you-buy. I also seem give explanatory information reviews. Anyway. I lot anxiousness buying mattress. If it's terrible, you'll spending large proportion life misery fix problem. Who wants that? Especially something expensive mattress? These people great. They patiently answered mattress questions treated like valued customer - times I called, man phone remembered name (and number!) took care me. When I failed buy box spring (why oh I think I could go without box spring??) able take care phone get box spring SAME day. Within hours, even. They even helped set mattress I DIDN'T purchase them, blew away. Their professionalism friendliness excellent. I recommend everyone who's market mattress, especially students, student deals fantastic.
I agree reviewers. I tried guys based Yelp reviews disappointed. I'm grumpy New Englander, frustrated small town, easygoing/careless customer service many PGH businesses. These guys different: professional, punctual (even snow!).
Other people may better experience company case us. We rented limo/bus bachelor party. Our driver Scott, completely clueless navigating city. Constantly making wrong turns missing exits. All thorough instruction go. Each destination took 3-4 times longer reach due incompetence. This caused us skip couple originally planned stops. After returning bus one stops informed Scott police come onto bus searched dogs. Really?!??! Why??!! How??!! We found bags rifled felt little violated confused. By point decided call night. More half passengers didn't care step back onto bus took cabs home. Just thought worst wrong. As enter highway realize Scott driven way ramp onto highway going THE WRONG WAY!!! He starts slowly reversing ramp oncoming cars honk swerve around us! Truly terrifying. After that, upset wanted get home. So several wrong turns finally get home. Absolutely terrible night. So you'd like book party bus include geographically blind driver, unecessary police involvement, near death experience overall sense frustration mixed panic go guys. Otherwise, I would suggest staying far, far away!
The worse "Chinese food", even white rice came ogle sweet sour chicken really bad. Please don't eat food.
Fried rice super bland. Chicken slimy. Service indifferent. No repeat visit me.
Boo! What happened location? It used happy fun! It feels depressing nearly everyone bare minimum get by? So sad.
I'm opposed chain restaurants TGI Fridays comparison ones area truly falls short "chain" expectation. I order Jack Daniel's chicken shrimp fries. The fries undercooked thrown haphazardly sauce holder. The shrimp cooked deepfried. The chicken fatty tasted like came freezer. Even water tasted weird. Fortunately, nice charismatic waiter staff friendly. I'd recommend TGI Fridays South Hills Village one day.
Went 5 others weeknight dinner. The server friendly, seemed little overwhelmed. Maybe short handed. The food even average. I ordered burger, overdone dry. Had drown mayo get moisture it. My friend ordered nachos arrived looked like broken taco shells middle, put cheese one jalapeño slice piece. Imagine 6 half-moons taco shell. Not like nachos I've ever seen, importantly even way served three prior times friend ordered them.
Came day late lunch friend. The place pretty dead seated right away. Took 30 minutes waiter show order drinks food then. Took another 30 minutes get drinks (2 beers draft) tables seated us served much faster us. Finally food came (soup, salad, boneless wings, fries). A different server delivered food looked like sitting awhile. After given food completely ignored, along others section. Us two tables waited 45 minutes try ask check (one table got left!) Being server myself, I try understanding wait staff. But ridiculous, restaurant even close busy section 5-6 tables ignored.
I understand chain, pretty standardized everywhere go, I found location especially bad. First, walk restaurant stale grease smell permeates throughout restaurant, nothing visibly dirty, smells like entire joint needs de-greased. Second, service, host typical younger girl, efficient without much professionalism, big deal. The waitress, "professional" , unfortunately way experienced great service, moreso experienced efficiently moving things along. Our food took long time, 'saved' telling us didn't know food wasn't ready yet, would check again, course, hot plates luke-warm food came soon after. She reeked cigarette smoke, i'm going make dumb assumption guess that's was. The food, typical TGI-fridays food, good enough, chain restaurant. Extremely unlikely i'd return.
Quite possibly worst service seating arrangement known mankind. I cannot believe restaurant actually redesigned accommodate bigger crowds better. The wait staff didn't even acknowledge party 9. When seated us 2 different tables couldn't figure accommodate us. See attached photo absurd situation weren't even busy.
Awful everything. From bad service, diluted soup, lame-no chicken chicken salad, PRE-fabricated pizza. AVOID THIS PLACE!
I really love deep dish pizza. The thick crust crunchy outside soft inside. The spicy, peppery sauce singe tongue. The mixture ingredients sliding chin bubbles mouth. That said, I really don't understand people go Pizzeria Uno. This chain done deep dish pizza McDonald's done hamburgers, Pizza Hut done pan pizza, Dominoes done hand tossed pizza, Taco Bell done Tex-Mex; made almost unpalatable. On menu: French onion Chicken bites Pizza pepperoni, hamburger, romano Looking past fact service best fact food came undercooked tepid temperature, food good. Don't get wrong, worst pizza I ever eaten, chain perfect example happens something becomes prescribed, overhandled, overthought longer resembles original piece art tasted good. I really never want return.
I agree reviews, store poorly laid honestly makes sense. Sometimes bigger always better. I used head often living near Shadyside stop Family Dollar & hit GE one run. I normally stopped Redbox movie. My debit card got hacked outdoor Redbox Get Go I'll go Redbox indoor like one. Anyways, I'd hit liquor store wine afterwards dealing long lines/wait & awkward clientele outside.
Ugh. Dirty. Long lines. Walked without making purchase .
Never Again. My friend I went Giant Eagle "quick trip" pick chips going party. Took us three minutes find chips. We stood line check half hour. It like window hell. The line "express," one "express" line one slow checker. I never step foot store again. I'm relatively new area told store referred "the dirty bird."
Came location quick run I regret immensely. Decided get Giant Eagle card since item sale. The clerk Customer Service rude I took ID back walked away. Her language impossible understand I didn't understand second mumbling yelled question me. This happened twice. They won't ever see again.
Avoid. Employees unhelpful rude. Went AM try find wife flowers birthday, stopped ask employee restocking shelves carried flowers. The employee looked me, ignored me, continued stocking shelves. This interaction fairly representative encounters I've store. Employees rude, unhelpful frequently give lot attitude asked anything customer. Shoppers slow, obnoxious, frequently hold lines arguing cashiers prices items. I've seen several families get loud screaming matches middle store buy groceries.Cashiers don't help matter, scan bag items slowly possibly can, make five minute trip twenty minute ordeal. This also giant eagle I've ever doesn't sell beer. The liquor store around corner employs equally rude individuals heavy police presence, probably prevent shoplifting. I would never think going place dark, all, I female. There plenty alternatives, including whole foods, target, trader joe's much classier giant eagle blocks away.
Figure I'd give Supercuts shot since Giant Eagle sells gift cards great fuelperks. I don't remember name one "bigger" woman there. I wanted grow hair longer looking messy. So I asked trim get sides/back cleaned up. She said ok goes. 5 minutes later, done. Yes, like bad date, done 5 minutes. I got home, showered, saw damage. It messy. What's worst every day grows, looked even worst. I'll stick usual barber.
Terrible! I got haircut hated it, kept waiting settle washes. It never look right, I fixed home rather going back incompetent people. I didn't even feel like hassle complaining worth it, I highly doubted I'd get money refunded I certainly didn't want touch hair try fix it. I figured, hey, place sucks haircuts can't mess eyebrow waxing, right? Right! But service bad I gave -- I got eyebrows done times much trouble, last time I went in, I called ahead put name told I would next list, show 20 min. My house 20 min walk there, perfect! I headed out, got 20 min, gave woman desk name reminded I'd called ahead. There one man sitting waiting, I seen across street walking 1 min ahead me. The "stylist" finishing haircut, I next, right, since I put name guy walked in? Nope! She called I said "sorry, I think I next, I called ahead told I'd next line" lady said "oh don't that." WTF?? You told clearly exactly that, craziness this? So I waited, figuring I'd already invested 20 min venture, I may well stick out. And waited, waited, one "stylist" cut man's hair 2 chatted back (ironically next chair facial waxing). They must "on break," maybe terribly rude idiotic, I sat waiting another full 20 min, I finally spoke ask someone would available eyebrows. The 2 chatty cathies back looked over, annoyed presence, woman haircut said "after I'm done here," I sat incredulous another 2 minutes getting leaving. Will never go back.
I went today! The cut terrible! I awful experience. They lady cut hair nice wanted leave early made disaster head!
This place features everything expect standard hole-in-a-wall Chinese restaurant. There's zero ambiance, offers quick take-out service rude. I decided give Tasty try it's conveniently located Highland Avenue easy parking. I ordered Kung Pao Chicken Crab Rangoon. Sadly, prepared Kung Pao Beef instead. It's extremely disappointing receive wrong food. It's even disappointing restaurant refuses correct order. While wasn't I ordered, food good...but better Chinese food there.
Note: Tasty credit card minimum $10 parking lot Tasty another standard chinese takeout place - didn't blow mind overall good, especially considering price. Before I continue, I come say food little tough - eggroll especially(As warned) - rice dark spots(I assume bottom cooking vessel). However, I chalk mistake I thought closed half hour later, did, consequently ordered 10 minutes closed. So, Tasty, get pass rice Anyhow, I ordered vegetable eggroll($1.50) general tso's tofu($8.25)(I've learned accept guilty pleasure). I ordered general tso's extra spicy - not. Also, tofu large chunks, seemed luck lately. I want surface area, I don't want figure cut food chopsticks. I say, though, sauce tasty - enough seal deal future order place. The eggroll, I said, tough.. It tasted good, tough, small... This probably won't future order, however $10 minimum I need order something else tofu... I hope soup good. The lady behind counter friendly decent phone didn't mention closing close I ordered. Portion size good, $10.44 cost me, I'll definitely able make lunch left.
Tasteless food arrived hour ordered cold. Will never order again.
Not Tasty At All.
Never received order left bad mood. The driver carry GPS delivery, know address right squirrel hill, listen (or understand me?) I tried give directions, asked pick food intersection 0.3 miles away apartment snow, finally yelled cancel order. Cannot comment food, whatever experience I left bad taste.
-3. Food arrived 2 hrs late. The delivery driver guy pizza place next door didn't know anything order. Food luk-warm arrived. The food completely inedible. The sweet sour chicken DISGUSTING. It neon pink color tasted like dried chewy dog food. Beef tasted like bad honestly I nearly puked first mouthfull. The thing edible rice, average best. There's $20 drain. Never again.
I wish zero star option give. This may worst "Chinese" I've ever delivered. First off, everything dripping everywhere. The entire bag soggy mess. Then get chicken chow mein. I'm even sure bothered cook that. My boyfriend couldn't even look taking bite, made sick. Next up, "general tso's bean curd." Under cooked properly drained water. I don't know sauce made disgracing General Tso's sauce existing. The egg rolls, Chinese classic, dark hard, I'm sure could possibly eaten them. The Crab Rangoon's... Generally favorite thing Chinese restaurant. I'm sure think attempting pass Crab Rangoon's here. These monstrosities completely inedible. The thing didn't mess order rice. It tasted looked like rice. When called complain I told restaurant said nothing wrong wouldn't anything situation. Awesome. Now stomach upset bites I took. I'm pretty sure place change it's name "Inedible Slop" it's far "Tasty."
Holy bat balls place bad food! Nothing flavorless, Americanized Chinese food. Asked items spicy possible got card board. Never, ever again.
Slow service average pizza. Convenient home depot.
I heard lots good things Vento's. Unfortunately I get experience things. The service slow lukewarm. The pizza expensive price restaurant advertised website http://www.ventospizza.com/. Also, credit debit cards here. You're directed ATM restaurant charges fee $1.75. I ordered ahead although I wait pizza I got I received cold good. I also ordered provolone sticks also taste good.
We visiting town spent 6 hours driving. Found place, read reviews Yelp OK, decided ordered two slices. Hum...sorry slices. More like two squares cheesy bread. When said aren't slices, lady register looked confused though pizzas always look like that. We obviously aren't locals way dressed lady (who talked terribly) notified us first ordered it! They also pictures real pizzas wall -_- It also took really long time cook little things weren't pizzas. Since I hungry, ordered another square unhappiness handed cooking wrapper paper plate, ugh. Definitely never going come visit again!
I got 'new' tires within two weeks got flat. I took car local mechanic see could get hole patched, said reason I flat previous patch blown - WAIT, WHAT? I got tire never needed patched? This supposed new tire. I took tire Flynn's told someone punctured tire, tried patch it. So resentful tire slashers? I find unlikely. After arguing guy telling logic far fetched said he'd give new tire "this time". I never go back Flynn's b/c way guy treated simple fact gave used tire!
Terrible. Preordered tires I arrived couldn't find order anywhere. Once got process I waited 2 hours put on... I originally told would take 30 mins. Slow, priced, I'll go elsewhere next time.
Last summer I appointment get new tires wait super long time. I also went week fix minor problem tire put on. They "fixed" free, next morning I issue. I called complain, "manager" didn't even apologize!!! So frustrated. Never going back. They seem overpriced, too.
I got tire replaced Nov. The tire bubble weeks. After initial challenges, spoke manager Keith issue take care off.
I've informed fellow Yelper closed season, I hope they're right! I find strange don't keep phone number service recording didn't cover course protect weather, vandalism, etc. Either way, I can't wait get game spring!
Don't waste time. We two different people come house give us estimates deck (one OWNER). Both times, never heard them. Not call, estimate, nothing.
Three months ago I brought 13 yr old golden retriever clinic ear problem. It diagnosed treated. Shortly returning home started cough gag like. I watched couple hours called vet see maybe allergic reaction medicine gave her. She uncomfortable. I asked though needed come back office. The dr told sounded like overheated put cold towels her. I told I didn't think problem hadn't out. At point open would another hour. Two hours later I vet hospital telling suffering heart problem really couldn't anything her. WHAT?!?! So I found put down. Fast forward now. I 14 wk puppy blood stool. They seen yet. I bring sample. Wait 24 hrs. They leave message it's positive call appt. I call. She wait 4 days seen. WHAT?!?!? Obviously pups good! Thanks Greentree caring animals... Absolutely worst care experience vets!!
Hoofah.
Good service last 2 times we've gone hairs son's kids meal.. A bit disappointing.
This place went great horrible. First visit flat tire recommended. Absolutely problems. Now I needed car inspected June, put SNOW TIRES car. NOISY snow tires summer! I told I didn't want tires told I would come back next day talk owner. When I went back owner told weren't snow tires. The tires called BLIZZARDS! I told noisy. He told come back another day. I tried tried NEVER time. Very rude get paid ethics.
Never go Rossi Tailoring Dry Cleaners 393 Vanadium Road Pittsburgh, PA 15243. I decided use local business dry cleaning. I dropped 3 shirts establishment Thanksgiving. It late January. I stopped half dozen times given ONE shirts. They offered $20 shirt shirts lost. Those shirts worth least $50 each, I refuse take $30 each. I tired run around, tired promised phone calls never happen (they NEVER called me). I wouldn't use services paid to.
I think location homestead ruined place. Dirty dirty dirty. Bathrooms unkept, entry door handle windows filthy Pizza much sauce drenched. Server coarse, refined Serving items old rusty. Temperature food hot Low quality, probably ok pittsburgher
Station closed. Sign blank fixtures store removed.
Two meals, recommendation friend lives near place, second trip, I compelled write. 'Rocky' would definitely describe experiences. On first trip, I went try (at time)raved Reuben. And YET find true good Reuben da burgh, I tried it. Well, proper bread, guy run store buy closest thing could find, proper bread, instead one 'raved about' Reubens, I received two mini-Reubens, basically took guts one Reuben, spread onto two sandwiches regular sized bread. I ate it. It wasn't great, swore they'd run bread. Bread not, still wasn't great. The atmosphere pleasant 'blue collar bar' kind way, staff nice, winning pitch Reuben. The second trip long day moving furniture friend. Sat back room, instead bar, felt like restaurant, course, big screen TV covering sports moment. I mood dinner time, scan, decided fried chicken mashed potatoes salad bar. My friend ordered one faves, breaded pork chops. We hit salad bar, uber-basic. Three soups (mostly vegetable loaded, left out), basic iceberg lettuce mix (very probably bag), veggie toppings, three four dressings. It basic salad, big deal. More less appetizer filler meal. The mind-blower trip ordering fried chicken dinner. Our waiter looked like 19 year old gas station attendant, skinny little blonde guy sweet incredibly naive face, air vapidity, confirmed I placed order. I asked chicken pieces came dinner, asked possible get dark meat. I never imagined confusing question could possibly be. It literally took two trips back kitchen 'ask', child honestly clue 'white meat' 'dark meat' meant. The first answer came back chicken came pre-portioned prepared bag, kind Kentucky Fried Chicken style...which didn't answer question, thus prompting second trip. After second trip back I heard cook holler 'Tell I'll fix up'. Well, chicken prepackaged dreck like you'd find freezer case Walmart, tiny good, potatoes slight tinge chem-spuds flavor, laden kind chopped green (parsley?), side basic brown gravy served 5 gallon buckets. Thank goodness basic salad bar. Even friend admitted pork chops different she'd expected. They also appeared freezer bag. The irony boy didn't know white meat dark meat, chatting customers...about baseball...and genius mindless sport baseball. Ahhhh da burgh. Third base? Nah...why bother many options around. Go grab beer chat black gold happen Carnegie...they help types ways area. Just don't go hungry actually tastebuds. From I understand 'used be' really good homecooked food. But apparently, mama left kitchen.
This place dirty smells food reely bad I took home feed dog. Hope don't get sick food like I did.
Well, started well. Food okay. Deep dish pizza good. But salad - tiny portion!!! We greeted seated well. But later service good. Bad bad service. First ask everything wanted. The server didn't even courtesy ask wanted anything would like go deserts. She handed check even didn't ask (we wanted order more). Later talked front, girl also listened said "okay", even sorry once!!! I would like go again... :(
Was disappointed food. It overcooked seasoned well
Met family work weekday. Not many people dining time dinners seemed take longer considering busy. As waiting pizza waitress handed us trivia game console use. We played 2 games trivia game life. The pizza came crust dry much flavor it. When presented check noticed charge $1.99 didn't know for. When asked charge charged us games played console gave us waiting dinner. I never heard anything like it. I wonder many people used games charged fee paid without noticing bill considering hidden discreetly middle bill. Then ready pay bill cash. We couldn't get server come take payment. Was disappointed. It probably awhile I go back ever.
I used come lot 4-5 years ago. But I stopped one reason another. I came back tonight long hiatus, I disappointed. The deep dish personal pepperoni pizza wasn't good -- sauce tasted bland, crust tasted oily bit overcooked stale, wasn't much flavor cheese. I haven't feeling well thought might me, husband tried said thing. He also said chicken parmesan sauce tasted bland. I feel bad -- little like looking old Taylor Swift album used love five years ago, except realize songs sappy looked completely different. I used love Uno, it's I remembered be.
Classic breakfast joint. Grimy looking hole wall located one end seedy looking strip mall. Window opaque due grease can't hardly see inside. On outside, dozen people waiting get in. When finally get inside, see 15 tables counter, occupied people walks life. What's attraction behind flea hole? The FOOD! Lots dirt cheap. I sat vacant stool behind formica counter ordered mixed grill. Potatoes, eggs, sausage, bacon Italian toast. A giant mound food guaranteed sooth hangover. I swear full mixed grill two pounds food. Neat thing grill right front see potatoes eggs frying pool fresh grease. All food, plus coffee tip around ten bucks. Cash only, put plastic away. Only bad thing could happen douche bag Food Network Travel Channel make place famous, I'll never able get in.
Food delicious--try pizza steak mini desserts! Fries extremely salty. Stars tables dirty, wait long receive food waters refilled. 3.5 stars comped desserts due wait.
Poor management, plenty empty tables, line still hour. Waitress negative attitude asked another minute look menu & stormed off.
We woke late missed breakfast hours favorite place. We needed go Waterfront errands decided lunch there. It around 11:30 restaurant mostly empty. They say back near doorway kitchen. We waiting waiting waitress come. During time realized child's birthday party 2 tables away. There 3 tables young boys table parents. They mostly well behaved LOUD!! Our waitress finally came took orders. While waiting food waitress standing right inside kitchen door complaining day job. She went bad looking new job. So one ear I complaining waitress birthday party other. We get leave food came. I Wedge Salad. It ok something I would order again. My husband's salad, Italian Chopped, better. It brightness salad lacked. IF I ever went back, that's BIG IF, I would order salad. I personal size Chicago pizza. It huge chunks tomatoes, sausage, cheese. For something took long get hot. It room temperature. I ate half. My husband got ziti sausage. It salty. I managed one bite done. My husband higher tolerance salt able eat it. What came away experience leave. Don't try stay experience bad. We throughly disappointed.
Love stores selection HATE girls chase around tell sales. If I wanted know I'd ask !!!
Interesting reviews less stellar already. I would normally review chain retail store, service I received today really got blood boiling. I state, I always types situations, I worked many years retail. I know you're supposed do. I know ways I've displayed exemplary service I know ways I've slacked off. I get it, I really do. So I'm store early. Hardly people there. Weird Semi-Annual Sale time year. Usually doesn't matter time you're sale, it's always busy. I went usual bins picked mess undies bras. Since one check counter I needed spot go things, I set started try chat sales chick. I actually always like this, shoot breeze, also get opinions items I'm buying. The girl behind counter non though.I asked bra said didn't know one, said work. I understand, can't try all. But thing really irked definitely hiding annoyance setting things counter. I even looked back make sure people checking behind me. Ghost town. Tumbleweed rolled by. No one. So I'm going stuff separating I want don't want she's sighing grabbing things saying "Soooo, DON'T want these???" Um, I'm asking help sort things. I'm holding line. I'm trying spend $$$ accidental XS pair undies got mixed in! After that, it's exactly said, acted. I never felt uncomfortable retail store before. I ended grabbing discards putting back (which I really don't mind doing, huffed puffed, I didn't even want deal her). The thing is, I nice entire time. I don't expect sit sugary sweet either. Just hired do. Be nice sell bras. If come work bad mood, real world going give hug. Suck job work don't talk anyone else ever.
Icy cold staff. I never visited store bad staff. I went return dress I bought online. It didn't fit sales girls ganged around looked horribly, judging continuously eyes going head toe. After time, told twice cute dress lingering like looking dead pet. I know cute dress, reason I bought first place. It fault don't dresses store try on. Dresses available online. I wait get mourning someone volunteer process return I could get store breathe.
Horrible Food don't waste money This worse cardboard covered cheese & sauce called pizza I've ever had, I haven't garbage since grade school cafeteria food, Most reviews rant great place much fun you'll there. IDK place cuz one I wan today East Liberty Home Depot getto beyond belief food bad & people aren't nice & friendly. Loudness issue lottery area sign saying back round noise number may wrong. Not one person decent customer service skills I ask girl 3 times speak I excellent hearing. I ordered small pizza I got medium greasy top crust stale. I looked forward getting great pizza man place really disappointed today.
This place worst service I've ever seen. I called two cold sandwiches told would 15 mins. When I got counter, lady working rudely told wait name called didn't ticket ring order. Um, okay...then walk get pay it! So I waited waited people came long got orders. The "workers" stand around spend time talking regulars trying act like big deal. I leave without order 40 minutes. DO NOT GO HERE!
Stopped breakfast disappointed didn't accept debit credit cards. Very inconvenient world cash pretty much way out. They however, refer store ATM, high service fee using it. They lost breakfast business day.
Used "staple" community years ago, Home Depot. My mom, uncles, aunts even grandparents would grab bite ever since I remember. On trip home, pregnant all, I went visit extremely disappointed. I ordered chicken salad, picked up, drove 15 mins family home discover NO chicken chicken salad!!! Wtf. When I called, guy answered already anticipating call, I assume I could explain error, stated "yup!" pretty much ended call. I debated several moments whether return, little one made decision me. When I returned, I thought I'd least offered pop troubles, even hear felt apology inconvenience...nope. My chicken placed top salad young girl register offered additional ranch dressing, trouble. "Wow" I could muster up. What happened Ventos nestled Fox's bar cleaners, front Sears...or one corner, across single apartment building? Now, like everything else East Liberty, regarded community staple quickly transitioning gentrified community tomorrow, fluff substance. Out old (school), new, literally. I hate ish...
Worst pizza I entire 40 years life. Tasted like sauce cheese toast. Frozen pizza better pizza. I wouldn't eat pizza free.
Wasn't terrible, But certainly wasn't great. Save hard-earned cash.
REDO! I went PF Chang's several years ago NOT pleased food presented me. My issue: I thought I getting Chinese food. My resolution: Try restaurant knowing reinvented American food names Chinese dishes I actually like eat. So returned PF Chang's lunch try American food caricature Chinese restaurant. There people restaurant. The two us seated largest corner booth left review menus. When waitress finally arrived ordered following items: Coca Cola Iced Tea Pan fried pork dumplings Sesame chicken lunch white rice egg drop soup Changs chicken white rice Our drinks soup came immediately. Unfortunately I brought wrong soup server disappeared I chance say anything. I could see across barren wasteland dining room even made eye contact several times, point could I get come back table. I tried soup disgusted placed end table. I didn't know didn't want know. Almost ten minutes later arrived quite happy job asked food was. I asked could bring egg drop soup. I didn't expect get stink-eye. My egg drop soup brought dumplings well caddy different sauces oils. The server really wasn't experience, gave stink-eye I told mixing sauces unnecessary since I knew would able mix myself. I mixed rice vinegar, chili oil, chili paste, soy sauce (my guess supposed tamari) create dipping sauce dumplings. I took bite soup somewhat better soup, still brown. I ate half bowl left rest server. It thick gooey flavor didn't wow. I saw reason continue. I moved dumplings, okay flavor them. The skins bit thick doughy. The meat inside balance attribute all. The sauce tasted little odd I tried remix still off. I tried components individually found either old, stale, rancid. We finished dumplings. Our lunch entrees arrived. I ordered mine extra-spicy, I guess came Pittsburgh Hot (super mild) lackluster flavor best. The meat tough sauce tasted soy sauce anything else. I tried Chang's chicken equally mollified. This supposed version General Tso's Chicken. Now I never General's chicken place. It always different. Many good different ways. This food, though, wasn't good. Chang's chicken fell category Sesame Chicken -- since tasted mainly soy sauce -- addition sugar. I don't understand anyone like place. Even Yoshida Sauce get Sam's/Costco tastes better.
Stars food only. 2.5 rating Got 8pm Saturday night, told us hour wait expected, took 30minutes seated bonus. Started lettuce wraps used fan seem bore now(FYI-love lettuce wraps cheesecake factory). I Singapore rice noodles. This thought immediately lu lu noodles asian cafe better. The fried rice disappointing vegetables tasted raw. Some good notes Dynamite shrimp, plump, juicy, tangy small kick. Sweet sour chicken minus kick. The service annoying. We less 45 minutes seemed like waiter rush get us there. Constantly asking could remove plate. I sternly say one point I let know finished. I found rude especially since wasn't even line point. I think travel elsewhere following movie. The result never quite met anticipation.
I like PF Changs. I think I've total three times (twice take out), I get vegetarian dishes, I've pretty tasty. I would definitely eat again.
I went place I LivingSocial voucher. Even voucher I feel like I paid much money. I think I could better food I went Giant Eagle across street heated Lean Cuisine. I wonder owners would put living social deal really would help business restaurant would simply improve quality food. The positives I give isn't pretentious waiter provided good service. It almost empty Monday 7 PM, desperately starving, able go better restaurants nearby heat food local grocer's freezer, might tolerable food option. Again, advisable desperately starving.
Minutello's going business. Last day operation Sunday, February 17, 2013.
This Shell station horrible. 1) The bathrooms aren't inside, like Getgo's. They're outside around sketchy corner, filthy dirty gang signs cigarette butts littered floor. 2) The store tiny cramped many items stock 3-4 people work *one* register. 3) The parking lot pitted dangerous, even Pittsburgh Pothole standards. 4) This place ghetto. This place thugs gangsters come get Slim Jims "hang out". People paid things nickles pennies. That first experience store. My second experience (months later -- I blame lapse memory) found driving Baum thinking "hey, I could use gas car crazy dirty. I wonder much Shell place's car wash is? It won't bad I never go inside store." So I google-texted real quick called them. After 8 rings someone picked phone mumbled me. I cheerfully asked much car wash was. -"We can't give information phone". --"Wait, what!? Why not?" "I want know compare Getgo's, $7". -"Sorry." --"Well that's stupid; let manager know I think he's idiot." -"Sure". Click. So come ebola laced bathroom, stay nihilistic attitudes!
Sadly I've times it's crowd pleaser girlfriend's parents come visit. There's nothing really WRONG it. The portions big food "alright" interior gives superficial impression you're encountering fine dining. The food sooooo bland though. Everything get P.F. Chang's get elsewhere Pittsburgh much lower cost it'll made precision better flavor. The honey chicken P.F. Chang's mediocre I could think eating heading Wai Wai Bloomfield getting tastier order 8 bucks. Last time server horrendous well. I don't think I've ever felt awkward restaurant. He brought girlfriend's father (Don) unsweetened tea told didn't bring sugar asked sweetened understand concept sweetening yourself. He got huffy Don kept asking actually seemed angry us. When came back take order Don ordered wife Janey (my girlfriend) I could order already started walk away. We actually yell get come back finish order. (not uncivilized malicious way, either) After must thought terrible diners (I don't think I've ever impolite someone currently work, ANYONE matter) showed silent plopping things passive aggressive way. It really embarrassing every time came conversation died. Obviously attitude one idiot can't hide bad day well doesn't really anything restaurant. But it's soooooo bland! Go somewhere else Chinese! Look Chinese Urbanspoon it'll give variety good, local places choose half price.
I like place. Its rarely busy GetGo, doesn't play stupid grocery-store point pricing games, Diesel now, pretty decent automatic car wash priced right. Its also conveniently right side road I'm heading westbound Baum. Other that, gas station. But, hey, least I clean car here.
Be careful paying cash here. I coughed $12 cash I pocket, went pump. After attempting pump gas, getting maybe pint, stopped working. I wait line get counter. After waiting, told pumped. We went round round, solution could print receipt, I could come talk manager it. This %100 unacceptable, wasn't much face utter indifference. Zero effort, horrible attitude. I've history great experiences here, that's saying lot. It's gas station, hard be? It's clear care all. This past incident seals it. I'm never going back, shouldn't either.
This adequate service station I've used I low fuel feared driving further. It air. On crowded Baum Blvd. little hard get out. I'm also negative towards pumps programmed ask car wash pump gas.
This first time PF Chang's I impressed. The service extremely slow even though Sunday night restaurant busy. The portions small. They also playing 5 year old pop music really loud. Pop music?! Come on--this "Asian Bistro."
I really enjoyed Mongolian beef pork pot stickers, There NO presentation pfc mixing sauces. One things sets pfc apart run mill Non franchise PRESENTATION experience. I extremely disappointed LACK presentation. Reservations: Our party arrived 15 minutes 5:30 reservations. At 6:11 informed reserved table given another party . Obviously someone dropped ball here..... When requested silverware table. Our waitress blamed hostess. Yes, theHostess provided silverware.. However It unprofessional waitress pass buck. As Patron I could care less who's fault is; $@&&@in fix it. Defiantly took away pfc experience. My Hot sour soup usally served with"noodley" things I drop soup. We weren't given "noodley " things . Not trying jerk things equal pfc isn't selling food much selling experience. This experience sets restaurant apart.
Surprised empty restaurant tonight. First time location. Great service, wasn't hard do..... Had combination Orange Shrimp Chicken Chicken Fried Rice. It typical PF Changs (Very good). You get Fried Rice kids menu $2.95 versus $8 big bowl regular menu.
Horrible experience. I rear ended stop sign, wasn't fault. Mikes repairs, poorly. Trunk lines off, bumper lines off, wires taillights hanging, rear header panel pushed accident. Taillights pushed accident. Mikes didn't repair issues. Even I told estimate. Also found chips dumped passenger side floor. They truly express shop. I wouldn't recommend anyone.
Our last visits left something desire, One things I always notice demeanor establishments employees. These people look miserable, one smiles greets appropriately, it's like get in, get out, turn tables, The food remained consistently good... order it. last time JB I came quick dinner, place busy yet passed 6 frowning waitstaff without getting drinks... 15 minutes left suiting table menus closed sitting edge table (HINT, HINT) left likely returning.
If look reviews see I positive person, tonight utter disaster!! We sat bar female bartender miserable. We ordered drinks unhappy did. She spent 20 minutes sending text messages took 3 smoke brakes one hour drinks empty. We ordered appetizers never came out. She actually brought us check never got food. By way people bar. Finally bus boy brought us food payed. We payed food came thought table ready. We finally got seated windows. Do sit windows cold. We ordered dinner drinks guess drinks. After food came asked drinks waiter said forgot. Nothing comped manager available. This PF Changs needs new management!! We never return. I give 2 stars food great, employees absolutely miserably hostess waiters bartenders. Steer clear changes made. It's worth headache.
We accident insurance recommended go Mike's. We dropped car days Christmas, understanding holiday would mean would delay. We didn't get car back month (the damage *that* extensive. It basically fender bender). Communication horrible; call them, wouldn't call us. After three weeks, called promised would done certain day. We called day confirm car ready told forgot order part would two days. Called two days later confirm ready. "No, it's ready yet. We'll call is." Days passed call. Finally called said "Yeah, car ready yesterday." Are supposed psychic? We picked car even getting home, "check engine" light came on. We took back Mike's said needed reset computer. They light went off. Left halfway home, "check engine" light came back on. We took another mechanic found Mike's missed quite things, resulting several hundred dollars additional repairs. Now submit kinds paperwork insurance company add supplement original insurance claim. Not fun!
We reservation Saturday night dinner arrived timely. THREE times 20 minutes hostess told us setting table. There 3 4 empty tables could see waited, yet seated. No one seated tables Not sure deal hostess. Also, extremely rude. However, server delightful food delicious. Too bad evening started wrong note. Management needs give lessons!
singapore street noodles. The end
Rude unwelcoming short haired black hostess. Drinks good. Greasy spring rolls Below par every way. No experience needed work
Walked tonight, Wednesday, 9:50, place empty. Asked table, hostess told us one moment finds one us, proceeded walk dirty table clean it! The phone rang answered stood door. When hung phone walked back table proceeded clean again!! Didn't say word us. Unbelievable! Will back there-- rude hostess!
I seriously don't know people love place much, food horrible. The rice never cooked properly.. And it's even Asian food. It's fake asian food. I never come anymore.
Three strikes you're out! We brunch months back, meal salty could barely begin eat it. That meal comped I figured day. We went back month later dinner, meal also salty could finish it. We willing try again, went dinner tonight. I ordered filet, like eating salt shaker. I shocked that, third time, I piss poor meal Casbah. I sent back, ordered sea bass. When I got end piece fish, raw. Needless say, I NEVER return restaurant. Looking back, I expected sister restaurant Mad Mex?
The wait little long, got seated service good. There always cold beer hand food die for.
We went last night Saturday night P.F.Chang located Kierlands Scottsdale. Terrible Experience!!! waiting one hour seated, ordered calamari appetizer came horrible strange salty sauce salt pepper mix side. I ordered beef broccoli husband ordered vegetarian dish peanut sauce . After long wait food came salty I could even eat much I hate complain I let waiter know, went get one less salt. My husband's dish OK. second one bit less salty meat terrible liver kind taste totally turned stomach. I feel reason added much salt hide bad tasting rotted meat. Very bad experience. Our waiter kind sympathetic. ruined evening :(
Animal Rescue League great! BUT, I'm disappointed dog trainer/behaviorialist, Lacey. I large papillon (a "throwback", vet called him), whose previous owners neglected undersocialized first two years life. As result, extremely fearful taken outside home, becomes overstimulated aggressive. I brought one ARL's Saturday small dog classes, freaked out, asked leave. Lacey said she'd contact set private class. She called days later, arranged private class 6pm Wednesday. I made arrangements leave work early drive back city get pup help! It's hard anticipate exactly much traffic Fifth Ave rush hour, I wound playing overly safe arriving 10 minutes early class. After minutes, Lacey noticed us came outside tell running fifteen minutes behind. I wasn't sure do, I couldn't really go anywhere cray-cray dog, much traffic go home come back again. So, said could wait inside small hallway. We went wait, naturally, smells sounds, pup got bit riled up. But, waited...and waited waited. At 6:25pm, I knocked door training room. Silence. So, I opened it. Nobody there, door outside open. I peeked out, was, people dog lesson me. I waited moment, hoping she'd notice look watch something, nope. So, I took dog walked outside car. She turned looked me, didn't acknowledge way. I went sat car dog minutes, hoping folks, dog, Lacey would wrap things up, no. They continued on. At 6:35pm, I knew I couldn't wait longer, I work I still needed finish done 9pm. I got car, began walking towards Lacey. She stared me, rather saying "We're finishing up," "Sorry, I lost track time," anything all. So I said, "We're going reschedule. It's past 6:30 now, I can't stay past 7." She simply replied, "Okay. I'll call you." I thought rude unprofessional offer type apology, even half-hearted explanation, whatever. No one said people skills, I suppose, getting dog help! Well, it's week half. No call Lacey! Needless say, I'll finding another, reliable trainer. I'm really disappointed, unprofessionalism, also lack caring dog. I barely interaction Lacey, even something didn't like, cared helping pup obviously needs it. I sincerely hope others better experiences, I hate knock even single star ARL -- Yelp review seems way warning others seek another trainer dog behavioral needs! :(
This fourth Changs I've eat ate. It pretty good. The food kinda like previously frozen. Had strange texture. Some changs chicken pieces stuck together breading sweet sour chicken mushy falling chicken. Overall still pretty good. Would eat one again.
I enjoyed previous experiences Casbah, past weekend disappointment. Despite reservation well advance, husband I seated horrible table right next hallway leads kitchen bathrooms. There constant stream distractions. Service also really slow sea bass bland. I expected better Casbah...
I love, love, love puppy. After visiting every shelter city finding nothing, came back next day seeing posting 2 month old terrier mix. Our poor little guy dumped park nice person brought ARL took in, waited 3 days someone claim him, neutered him. He wasn't even supposed floor yet got there, super helpful brought us let us take home. The staff super helpful wonderful incredibly anxious fiance- imagine first time dad bringing home baby! The reason get 4 stars poor puppy SO sick. We've 3 weeks he's got awful cough hasn't responsive antibiotics. I know hard keep dogs isolated, I really think 8 weeks little early neuter puppy especially found park- much stress! Hopefully little guy starts getting better soon, we're awfully worried him! Still love ARL though!
They give tiny portion I got sweet n sour chicken lunch I still hungry plus rice cold would I come Back maybe
Dumb, dumber dumbest running hostess stand. They gave 7 different estimates wait time, none accurate. John Tapper needed property.
I went family late night ,the food good , looked like left , I hate it. The service professional!!!!!!
My introduction youth (dating back AWAYS) gourmet class. 15 years later, still delivers goods. Cheers!
I used work here! Haha, many moons ago tho. Usually leave restaurant job sick food people even I left I still love going talking staff getting something eat drink hanging out. I'm Changs Chicken junkie I can't stay away long. The bartenders always best I've ever seen matter many changes they've gone one places even years years later people work still love it! Says lot people. Changs Chicken, Chicken Lettuce Wraps Pork Won Tons though standard fare always amazing. Some excellent dishes Kung Pao Chicken, Shrimp Dumplings, Mongolian Beef The Ahi Tuna. It might chain restaurant one one strongest links chain!
I've Casbah several times dinner experience even better last. I tried several pastas, seafood, meat dishes single one ever disappointed. The aspect Casbah I feel sets apart even Big Burrito restaurants quality service. They extremely polite, knowledgeable, hard-working!
Pasta fest called deception fest. We got email inviting us come pasta fest thinking would regular portions discounted price. WRONG smaller portions higher price. I never felt ripped off. $15 one meatball three bites pasta. The server warned us small portion wow . You got time never again.
This place's reputation high-end restaurant entirely undeserved. Every single entrée party ordered oversalted bland. And price I expecting much, much more. If you're looking quality food $25-35 per plate, go Meat & Potatoes.
A years ago, I lost partner love life tragic accident. While struggling horrific grief difficulty getting back life I knew it, grief counselor suggested I "help something else" order help feel better. We decided since I animal lover I would try volunteering animal shelter. I working, I lot time wanted shelter feel right. I visited few, good work, one kept drawing back ARL. Yes, building old, it's bit run down, doesn't stop staff administration best little best space. I saw bathroom "renovated vet tech office, I saw janitor's closet renovated made "rodent room." Where cats lived cages along halls ARL new building next door, old gas station made "Cat Adoption Center!" When staff still young going 5-10 years + shelter, (same place employment matter) know something place right! I volunteer easily 30 hours week ARL, I get see good, bad ugly, I tell first hand good staff, Executive Director, Dan Rossi, work goes animals. The staff knows EVERY one animals, care them, keep doors WIDE open domestic wild animals, even means staff member volunteer takes cat dog home! The answer never ever "no" animal. I also volunteer Humane Society United States travel around countryside working dogfighting raids, cruelty, hoarding, natural disasters, ARL never said I ask bring animals back incredibly sad inhumane situations. Technically, numbers, "no-kill" shelter, open door people often call "kill shelter." Yes, sometimes animal euthanized. The ARL Animal Control shelter city Pittsburgh bring upsetting disturbing signs animal cruelty. It also mean it's dog bit kid saw news. The ARL obligation society let dangerous dogs back street, euthanize dog sick aggressive humans animals, trust me, I held many dogs put sleep I always thankful vet staff compassionate euthanasia humane manner. That's tough job, it's heartbreaking, cases done good animal safety society. I admire work staff ARL continue devote time thank wonderful work behalf city Pittsburgh wild domestic animals alike. We lucky area city shelter.
Please adopt pets update standards. I hate think animals living cages, but... !! At least two cats adopted September diagnosed herpes virus vet, contagious cats. !! AKA, likely shelter staff washing hands handling pets testing virus fatal kittens. I recently adopted kitten shelter--I picked Pittsburgh Public Market adoption station. I told tested common feline viruses up-to-date vaccinations. These untrue statements. The kitten herpes virus vaccinated this. My roommate, me, I warned upper respiratory infection (URI) occur virus others, told neither tested vaccinated herpes virus. They gave paper vaccinations, vet-speak, I took word it. Furthermore, shelter staff put kitten roommate's name mistakenly (and claimed called would fix mistake, wouldn't), got sick, one clinic would return calls--I'm guessing since I wasn't owner according records. I email get response, basically said sorry didn't return calls problem now. They never apologized kitten's health asked feeling better. Where's compassion animal? So I sick kitten hands. I took Big Easy Lawrenceville stopped eating, Dr. Ruiz best. She took care him, cost $160 treat virus picked shelter. The Animal Rescue League shelter/clinic said cover expenses this. After I already taken elsewhere, clinic staff said would given discount I waited two days go clinic, would wait two days kitten wouldn't eat?? And virus makes ineligible pet insurance. It cost hundreds extra dollars year keep healthy. Had I fallen love little monster, I would taken back another shelter. That's person adopted kitten virus did. Whenever gets outbreak, get another URI. This means lethargic cat sneezes, gags, coughs can't breathe won't eat he's congested smell food. It's sad--protect cats herpes vaccination, please! Oh, case wondering: like humans, cat herpes fo' life. Poor little guy. This also ruins plan getting another cat future. Bad shelter!
Our cat recently came health issues could afford address. He pain decided humane thing put sleep. We went ARL asked receptionist options available us. "Well basically thing sign euthanasia" said uncaring, apathetic voice possible. We heartbroken course. "Go wait door someone meet you." After minutes another woman came took carrier. "I'll bring carrier back minute." We said no, that's okay, keep carrier. She said okay took cat back. And it. No kind words, sympathetic gestures, "Would like moment I take him?" No "I'm sorry." Nothing. For us one worst days lives nobody ARL seemed care, least trained pretend care, one bit. They get couple stars offering necessary service. But that, place associated making terrible day much worse lack caring empathy.
Staff members always come short. A past kennel worker sold litter pit bull puppies east liberty shelter made aware excused it. They lie surrendering families don't want cold hard truth, good, bad ugly leak public. They lie ! They kill many many animals subjective behavioral test dog hating staff performs . They kill pets space pittsburgh shelter. Many volunteers walk eggshells know animals life hanging balance afraid speak allowed back volunteer . Weak leadership. This cities highest cat dog death rate shelter rescue western pa
This terrible shelter. It appears routinely turn away (or kill, unless state take back) cats "overcrowded." They tell cat " behavioral issue" address turning said animal away. Mark take cat (or dog, etc.) back else risk "put down."
I'm conflicted proceed review. I think place necessity city, open-door policy ensures one turned away, saving thousands animals, staff members unprofessional RUDE people I've ever met. When say animal euthanized unless health behavior issue, believe 'behavior' broad term. In words, "Any animal doesn't tolerate, also welcome, handling strangers euthanized". I found I fostered 5 kittens, 7 week old kittens put 'fussy'. What hell kitten isn't fussy?!!!! They're curious little guys want explore! When I took kittens offer adoption, exam room right next room full barking howling dogs. There girl back howling top lungs laughing, I guess thought funny dogs terrified distressed? The tech handled kittens (that terrified noise) roughly, shoved back crate, injuring one them. When one kittens tried stop shoved crate, scratched her, became angry, telling would euthanized acting way! Luckily, volunteers must handled helped calm them, able offer 2 adoption. If wasn't volunteers, place would hellhole poor babies. . When I took one kittens I ended adopting (to save certain death) spayed, extremely rude tech handed box take home. After hour half drive home, I opened box find kitten wrapped tightly towel couldn't move, another towel around face tight couldn't breathe! I never angry life! I don't care rude me, take animals! The poor baby probably hissed scratched tech, tech decided protect vicious 2 pound kitten immobilizing her. I fostering 2 kittens sick. They told better getting well home, Well doubt, I got home, FILTHY, feces backside, weigh less 2 weeks ago I took there. I asked 'vet tech' kind food fed them, said, 'Oh doesn't matter'. It definitely matter! Suddenly changing animals food causes gastic distress, vomiting diarrhea. Even cheapest bag pet food tell that. That's probably got sick! I'm actually afraid complain anyone cats I fostered adopted, I'm terrified hurt kittens! I hate say, "Don't go here, don't take animals here", animals suffer! But bad experience, get names, write managers CEO, let know specifics. Hopefully getting wrong people there. Starting African American receptionist. I'm sure review end "Not recommended" reviews. It seems truthful reviews get pushed back?!!!
They dogs neutering surgery correctly, resulted opening next day. The listed emergency number answer I get ahold I immediately told would least $160 seen. I take somewhere else get seen back animal rescue league done right. My poor baby went hell. Never I take dog there.
There bunch pretentious self ritiuos self entitled ass clowns. The pious smiles stupid faces topped busy find dogs stollen colllar. I left dog car less 30 minutes, shade windows strumpet called 911 animal control takes dog "shelter" charged $90 get back, top losing colar. Then treat I'm villian reporting woman said dog wasin car sun windows 2 hours. I guess trust total freak show losers owners. I literally rescued dog woods Texas (a kill site state), 12 lb, starving, scared, looked like skeleton. She sick six ways sunday. I spent $2000 dollars getting healthy, got kick apartment didn't allow pets. Then spent another $1000 dollars got punchured lung dog park . This, dog I found woods. Do really thing I'm going lock car die? Am I really villian? The crew "shelter" need check attitudes treating people like Michael Vick. OH YEA! When I asked another option besides paying outrageous bill, uncaring bearded rope-pusher casually said "we euthanize, put adoption, would euthanize".... I hate place everyone it.
I love do. But I puppy spay/neuter clinic. He came home, next day showed signs UTI, (bloody urine, straining pee). So I took veterinarian said even disappointed, prescribed antibiotic. Yes, you're getting money it. But little bit easier little guys, wasn't dropped way pulling tugging poking resulted bloody UTI. I'm disappointed. Just it's cheap doesn't mean it's worth it. Please reconsider clinic, continue adopt visit staff somewhat friendly... I'm almost afraid know treated dog I left. On better note, incision isn't infected seems alright.
Vincent done several hems jacket alterations men suits me. Items always one time done well. I would recommend place anyone searching tailor Pittsburgh. It seem little expensive, worth it, done correctly.
The Rite Aid Baum used pharmacy, I flipped CVS location convenience (on route to/from work). At first, experience unlike recent reviews. I, too, hate ask clerks open locked compartments hold razor blades, etc. BUT... The pharmacy staff terrific. I NEVER friendlier, knowledgable responsive pharmacy staff drug store. The service first-rate extra care attention detail deeply appreciated.
Tire replacement, told would take 1.5 hours (when I existing appointment). It's almost 2.5 hours I'm still waiting. Ridiculous.
Went slow leak fixed tire. Got 4:40. No one could look appointment 5. One person working couldn't look car. No appointments available tomorrow. Fail!
Exceptionally poor maintenance service. They refused start heat mid-October centrally heated apartment grew chilly Fall progressed. On another occasion, refused change rusted weak lock. The lock eventually gave way I locked bathroom. After incident, I requested lock changed immediately, one owners threatened saying default lease agreement keeping apartment clean leased us. Dealing Rocco Elisabeth nice, good luck getting anything done Nick seems increasingly handling operations Rockwel.
This place gone downhill I don't expect going back. In fact, I don't expect business past Christmas. They raised prices, changed menu, removed several favorite dishes menu. The veggie dumplings gone, jasmine iced tea gone, mini-dessert gone. The food meh. My broccoli mushy ginger chicken sauce like candy sweet.
We hadn't PF Changs awhile I remember why.... The service terrible. The silverware dirty. We waited almost 15 minutes water glasses brought table. The waiter forget several things asked all, food tasteless portion sizes smaller lunch sized portions. We dinner crowd started lack service food quality can't blamed busy time. Don't think going back there.
I little peeved gluten free version Buddha Feast cost $10.50 regular version cost $9.50. So you're charging dollar give gluten-free version veggie, tofu, rice platter?? Regardless, it's worth get gluten-free soy sauce (which I buy I know isn't THAT expensive). When dish comes out, it's literally steamed veggies rice. No tofu, seasoning sauce. I ask there's tofu response tofu gluten it. When I ask sauce (aka flavor) dish I'm informed I could've ordered gluten-free dish's sauce go along it. Thanks info now...yes I'll take GF beef broccoli sauce side. The sauce comes it's actually tasty food finally interesting enough eat, even though I'm extra annoyed paying $10.50 steamed veggies rice menu made mention wouldn't get flavor tofu. To top based miserable I feel now, I'm pretty sure beef broccoli sauce brought contained gluten anyway! So I paid more, got less, still got gluten food!?!? Not happy customer. Not going back. Not going recommend anyone.
Disappointing :( I expected PF Chang's. All I say better Chinese non chain place, cheaper. Wouldn't go back. I want Chinese go How Lee, China Palace.
If I use one word describe experience : Depressing. And even generous. I came two friends new years eve continuing remainder evening. We ordered drinks bar waited table. My friend I ordered Asian pear mojito, decent. My guest ordered jack coke immediately depressed discover jack Daniels splash coke color. When got table, hoping better experience. Little realize, would suffocate holding breath. We ordered combination fried rice, described containing egg, chicken, pork, shrimp, beef. When arrived table, egg present ones wearing faces. We also ordered honey chicken beef broccoli hoped better quality. There complaints chicken, star evening. The beef disappointing say least. To start, kitchen sent Mongolian Beef, rather intended entree. When refired dish, presented, looked better actually was. Never life I bit piece beef instantly fear cracking tooth. The beef dish tough, crunched (again new first me). It likely long time I return. My regret I cannot leave 1/2 star rating.
Let's put food aside moment. Let's talk customer service moment. Earlier week, I misfortune dining Waterfront P.F. Changs. It bitter cold outside. Their food usually good, husband I ducked get bite went movies. We seated quickly ordered wanted make show time. I didn't notice first, I soon realized cold restaurant. I asked heat I told heat - broken earlier day. I asked server hadn't mentioned came in. Well, I already know answer - would turned around gone somewhere else. Then manager came apologized. I mentioned might nice warned heat (as I sat coat). He seemed agree me, still allowed least another 20 people enter restaurant without saying word them. Not one word. Oh, offer dessert. That's usually someone f**ked up. In case didn't matter. I quickly ate left make movie. This second bad experience I've particular location. Last time I there, floor pretty dirty always makes nervous. What kitchen look like? I'm P.F. Chang's chain I gone states always liked food. This location needs get act together.
disappointed, service ok, used be, food wasn't great either, cook used way much pepper rice. Chicken tough. So college kids end sitting behind us, acting like bar. We kids us I came close saying something, manager seen took care it, table twice.
My girlfriend I ate first time eating PF Changs I heard good things restaurant. Starting service server ever tell name I also waitress I expected good service begin quiet receive food never came back ask attentive however work service industry decided give food chance since that's come for. My girlfriend got appetizer edamame fried green beans edamame Bland needed seasoning green beans spectacular although say enjoyed sauce. entrees I sweet sour chicken I sweet sour chicken several Chinese restaurants including take I displeased sauce poportion I've better cheaper. My girlfriend chicken fried rice fine it's also easy dish overall rated restaurant one star even care stay dessert even though desert look appetizing. I pretty disappointed first experience I don't think I return never know
My family I treated well.
I've bad experiences times now. I wrote panera bread haven't heard back. Bad service around!!! Basically, ordered food, ran wanted, decided make us something else telling us. When got food, asked made us instead ordered---'oh closest wanted'.....hmmmm tell us pay, give us money back. Really, don't get much pay panera. Its good all.
Service pretty bad. They napkins cup lids. I ordered chicken tortellini pasta chicken noodle soup. My chicken seemed undercooked pasta wasn't chicken soup.
Non existent internet service. I came work laptop internet speed wasn't strong enough. :(
This Panera Bread location ideally located Waterfront shopping center midst several shops large parking lot. The space much larger many locations I ample seating, always good thing. Unfortunately, service slow unfriendly (there line took moments someone notice customers trying order). I surprised I automatically given baguette meal rather offered choice bread, apple bag chips. Perhaps location, maybe one-off oversight. As I mentioned, plenty seating, options limited tables disgusting trash desperate need wipe-down. If lunch rush, I would sympathetic, handful patrons entire establishment. I also upset WiFi functioning. Despite nitpicking, food fine standard Panera, stellar location.
It several months since I visited Panera Bread. It bakery cafe chain free WiFi. Prices reality although time time change seasonal offerings. Food fair. You order given buzzer let know food ready. They use real dishes silverware. The menu gives calorie count item purchasing. One popular feature items pick two half sandwich salad soup pair two items. You also get choice apple roll add dessert $1.00 I disappointed learn removed French onion soup menu. I asked removal learn something wrong one ingredients. The disappointment year making gingerbread men one favorite holiday treats. Instead offering holiday themed sugar cookie. I normally eat I'm hurry don't time sit regular restaurant. They use fresh breads cater. You also order holiday baked goods breads parties.
Stopped Sunday morning. The light roast coffee cold. I ordered Steak & Egg breakfast sandwich. The Steak ice cold. The slice tomato I add ripe. Panera quality consistent matter location visit. Very disappointing considering pricing structure.
DO NOT EAT THE PASTRIES! We saw manager nightly count pastries touched everyone fingers (no gloves). I commented said excuse touching pastries gloves??! He looked said, "I'm touching I'm tapping them". Yuk, said that's disgusting people eat that. He looked went back. I told cashier Thomasina would calling owner.. that's unexceptable. She reluctantly gave owners name. Luke I'll calling U tmrw!
Hands best cappuccino you'll get Pittsburgh. I yet disappointed. Consistency quality coffee joint I'm looking for! (Oh alright delectable treats always don't hurt either... Apple dumpling?!?!)
The people work rude. I gone back times thinking may person working day rude person, happen every time. I young hip person felt place there. It like walking someone's house bothering them. The people working behind counter act like interfering conversation. Plus dirty. Perhaps people working try cleaning place instead talking other. I go back again.
This one places I really want love. You walk in, super cute, nice ambiance, friendly staff, people reading talking... None bad things. I got regular coffee black sandwich, came close $15. A little pricey whatever. The sandwich gross. Old bread past stale gummy gross stage, almost toppings weird spread (it mushroom sandwich). The coffee little off. I couldn't put finger why, didn't seem right. Then I looked back room.... There bread stacked EVERYWHERE. No wonder mine stale. I might go back coffee pinch, I wouldn't get food again.
Service gone considerably downhill. Orders messed up, longtime staples menus dropped, prices jacked up. Needless say, last time going there.
The problem I experience compared last examination lasted 3 minutes. The vet checked ears, teeth, nails called day. I came home looked teeth saw pup "slab fracture" still attached gum. The vet didn't mentioned "exam" telling buy finger brush brush teeth. I primarily vaccination shot they're going charge examination, proper examination. I felt I rushed there. I took dog another vet told slab fracture, gave info usually happens, potential problems cause, recommendations ways fix problem.
I allow dogs go Dr. Bezak. I've couple Chow Chow's lot vets afraid of. Doc Chow knew look breed. He taken good care years.
It always feels like everyone shops target moving slow motion. Just sayin'. Otherwise, it's pretty much like Target. The lines crazy long today I buying one thing. I relieved sent cashiers opened lines. It definitely expedited looking long wait.
My experience great all. I went like 2 weeks ago attempting get help home phone. I walked store expecting greeted elderly gentleman, alas wasn't walked back home phone department get assistance told geek squad warranty good here. I told ignorant employee asking new one free... simple be. I paid 10 extra geek squad support couldnt even give free home phone deserved. I asked speak manager told leave. After police came escorted WRONG person out!!! I went freindly store best buy electronics took care me. I never go back target ever AGAIN. 1 star
Watch looks like something sale. They mark rack table big buy one get one 50% sign, stuff rack sale.
Let's start review saying point, girlfriend I going Jos. A. Bank mine groomsman's suits. Allow give numbered breakdown issues encountered renting Men's Wearhouse groomsmen friends wedding. 1- They never contacted us fitting saying would followup call. The groomsmen I follow repeatedly get answer tuxedos would arrive staff short honest questions phone. 2- They sent two tuxedos Homestead asked sent Ross Park Mall fitting. 3- When one us called two days prior wedding ask tux's arrived guy answering phone said "Oh... I don't know" (insert awkward, pregnant pause waiting say "Let check you") instead said "Well, I'm going hang now." And made good promise, hung up. 4- Despite saying we'd get call weeks ahead wedding resized case one us gained lbs winter, call never came basically hope everything fit needed to. 5- We one point informed MW emails file tuxes arrived store would receive email letting us know. Not single groomsman received email effect. 6- One groomsmen randomly received black tie everybody else white. Another received studs. We discovered approximately two hours show-time relatively far civilization. 7- On picking tux I informed associate "I'll unable get Men's Wearhouse days wedding, alright?" responded "Yeah fine" girlfriend graciously dropped tux days later learned $100 late fee, I totally caught guard. 8- My girlfriend also caught totally guard associate Ross Park Mall incredibly rude informed said late fee. 9- As Best Man I given coupon card $50 next rental Men's Wearhouse. Since I another wedding next month rentals MW I figured would opportune time use it. Imagine shock paying next weddings rental, I presented coupon told "Oh, isn't this. That intended YOUR wedding. Oh expires December 31st year." 10- The groom decided use coupon purchase suit wedding own, rather rent tux occasion. He ensured Homestead staff coupon would fine purpose got fitted it. When went pick suit pay aid said approved coupon instead forced argument associate insisted could use coupon towards suit associate weeks earlier insisted could use. Granted, I speaking another person take much salt may, reiterated fact several times prior wedding last week. Over friends wedding weekend, time anything even went slightly wrong around wedding, joke Groom Groomsmen "Effing Men's Wearhouse." For example, restaurant, "Wait I asked onions sandwich. - Effing Men's Wearhouse!" "Noise complaint hotel room? Men's Wearhouse." Another groomsman looked discovered wrong color tie one us received said "I hope you're taking notes impending wedding" I replied "Perhaps I could find better service GoodWill Western PA" Congrats Men's Wearhouse. You became butt every joke every mishap entire weekend around wedding provided suits. TL;DR - 10 mistakes, several rude associates 1 future groom going Jos. A. Bank.
Worst customer service. From minute enter, sense air racism inside store. There one help even request service, demeaning attitude lack personality gave sense suffocation one would feel like getting store immediately. Unfortunately, portray wannabe Brook Brothers, fail provide customer service Brook Brothers . I would rather continue go Brook Brothers pay $50 shirts good customer experience without racism. It pity racism still exists. Mens wearhouse never going get online retail businesses.
Yikes! Awful experience. My husband popular guy, lots weddings last couple years he's unusual size -- 44 Long. During pickup 3 short days ago Waterfront location - measured 16 weeks ago - I asked "why thing like trash bag handsome stud", response "oh sorry, nothing it" complete lie. "We can't alter rentals, sorry". You see, return label I noticed jacket 48L. Remember I said he's actually 44Long? Men's Wearhouse Waterfront gave husband tux one, TWO FULL SIZES TOO LARGE. Future grooms -- rent tux local provider. Or, better yet, send groomsmen professional tailor get measured free. Then, order tuxes online Vietnam. You'll get tux keep price rental craptastic wage slave US.
So, I used come time two years ago amazing. I thought I discovered Shangri-La coffeehouses Pittsburgh, but, much chagrin, staff gotten ruder less professional time. Seriously, people major attitude problems need adjustment. I refuse pay good money (and always tip!!!!) people glare judge customers. Also, people heard showering?!?! When smell overpowers smell coffee coffeeshop there's definitely something wrong. Their sandwiches taste terrible well, they've always terrible. Never going unless re-staff pronto!!!
It's delish.
I got pizza Saturday night pinch. Looking place sells slice, I drove around while. Not by-the-slice pizza, also favorite toppings. I also hate crust that's thick, -- although I prefer even thinner -- I pretty satisfied crust. The thing could improved salad. We got grilled chicken salad. The chicken fries okay, rest pretty run mill. As pizza, I'll definitely back more.
I used place I moved New York, I excited morning I decided get coffee girlfriend I. Seriously, fuck place. I came in, everyone gave over, I get brooding barista act, patron someone worked service industry, I feel like definitely sort humanesque emotion displayed people. All three behind counter looked like I ten eyes dicks eyebrows. I asked Iced Skim Latte, got hot one, hey, small fuck up. It exasperated sigh I corrected them, I could've fucking done without. Still didn't get iced skim latte. Also, I point something use proper name it, I feel like shouldn't problem individual average intelligence. I ordered apple dumpling, pointed apple dumpling, thought I watching put there, I turned head second, got fucking Danish. It wouldn't big fucking deal, IF THEY WERENT FUCKING DICKS THE ENTIRE TIME I WAS THERE. Yeah, five five stars, definitely gonna go right next screenplay.
This store bad service. The service staff rude rude rude. Save money, shop elsewhere.
Coffee!! I Keurig Vue store I've able find carries Vue cups. The place I find online I'm morning person. So waiting week shipping option sometimes. Aside I feel like jam pack store full everything can. Not that's bad thing make hard find looking sometimes.
This go towels bathroom accessories. They also affordable bedspreads pillows. It nice place shop helpful employees. I hate searching saving coupons receipts would prefer retail establishments keep prices low. The cost time efficiency managing coupons, stores consumers could easily eliminated savings passed lower prices.
Is Pittsburgh thing? Maybe excuse crumby diner chain. The times I dined (if that's want call it) E'nP I felt like committing Sepaku (Hari - Kiri). I never got sick food disgusted stooping level gastronomy. Nothing really worthwhile menu (maybe burger- much mess up?). My gut tells trust E 'N Ps. No offense truck drivers America b/c keep supplies selves It reminds truck stop restaurant without truck drivers. I always seem migrate salad bar get weirded deal utensils pick salad. So I wind washing hands getting salad stuff. The waterfront E 'N P perhaps cleanest one I that's saying much b/c patrons kinda off. So extra star location. But it's like I would ever say friends NY, SF, London wherever..."Hey come Pittsburgh sure go E 'N P get flavor city". Obviously place appeals certain class people I guess I can't part much I want times.
Ugh. I've always Eat n Park fan, place awful. It Friday night granted pretty busy, gawwwwwd. It seemed like every single employee around 16 years old. The service slow. We ordered appetizer platter cheese fries split. Easy enough, right? Well didn't fry anything long enough soggy breading falling everything. My drink never refilled. Even worse, noticed ants crawling window sill next us! Half hour later server decides ask "You gettin' dessert?" We ordered slices pie go. My "slice" strawberry pie two strawberries crumbs crust. We went front pay find one lady register (who seemed sole adult employee) counting drawer nobody else sight. We stood evil eyed minutes finally took break conversation say someone would us. A minutes finally girl server rings us up. I asked different, ACTUAL slice pie, managed get five minutes later. Basically whole experience pure torture, disappointing.
Being next door corporate would higher expectations. The breakfast bar lame. Back home (fayette county) seems lot variety corn fritters, apple cinnamon "thingies", little potato cakes name few. The salad bar bad, side dishes offer usually ruined meat makes sense tiny ham cubes bacon bits already bar anyone wanted add linguini salad whatever, could. The late night patrons bit unsavory, speaking which, ex roommate used work I could tell stories I don't want freak out.
Wing night wednesdays! 50 cent price wings $1 beer William Penn Tuesdays body hurting badly next day, Buffalo Blues eat wings. There ton sauces pair wings. They bring 5 time plan ordering next selection wings come take quite bit time come. I don't think I ever eaten food except wings pretty good. The downside place service really really slow.
I went around 12:30 AM January 1, 2011, New Years' Eve. They breakfast buffet laid out. I'd barely gone Eat 'n Parks past year local one (in Edgewood) horrible, I pleasantly surprised nothing wrong here. We seated quickly, waiter handled beverage orders quickly, buffet fine. No problems all, except place got completely packed around 1 AM bit trouble tracking waiter get check... That wasn't big deal, though. I can't justify giving 3 stars due fact Eat 'n Park isn't exactly fine dining, got filling food minimal hassle, good experience overall.
Superbowl Sunday Blues. came meet group friends watch " really cares game" show. I mainly interested seeing Madonna. I say server gave us utmost attention. We seated tables near bar mid restaurant wobbling driving crazy. At request party moved us front center much better stable seat. Much better view see Material girl! So server gets 5 STARS! Not reason, kept glasses full kept checking us, took stride ordered different times separate checks. Very classy, wish I could remember name. Young girl dirty blond hair. The food pretty blah opinion. Bar food none exceptional. We nachos slightly stale chips. Good size. Everyone burger sandwich. As I glanced friends Pulled pork looked dry sad left sitting plate. She said "EH". I ordered Gobbler Club sandwich. It humongous tasty, pretty dry. How go wrong club thick cuts turkey sit well I didn't like all. Bad texture. The commercials time fun friends saved experience I wouldn't go back eat. Just drinks sports. I like location. Easy park. Close shadyside. Madonna really show stopper night unless performs I likely won't back.
Oh mighty fallen. This place used good. Something happened wings small dry generally bad. Since wings supposed thing pretty unacceptable. Writing review makes sad great place drink beer watch game. The beer reasonably priced food expensive is. I essentially live across street I know I'll go back, I hope poor reviews help turn things around kitchen.
Good place watch sports game. Beer specials good. Food overpriced though. The wings worst I've ever had... I've alot wings growing Buffalo, NY.
This worst service (or worst non-service) I ever experienced. Since I can't give zero stars, I'm giving service one. We didn't eat anything I can't comment food. My husband I went Buffalo Blues last night. We stood empty hostess stand while. When one came seat us, couldn't find anyone seat us, seated figuring that's supposed do. The bar full, packed. There two tables guests, one empty plates table entire experience. After seemed like forever, husband got find server. He literally walked around restaurant find someone, couldn't. He tried ask bartender, elusive. When finally found server, acted totally shocked there. Maybe someone job, wouldn't surprised find hungry people restaurant. She came table, got drinks (a soda water) asked us ready order. When said said would back. We could see chit chatting another server, again, couldn't get attention come back take order. After another ten minutes waiting return, put dollars table soda left. We ordered pizza local shop picked way home. Twenty-five minutes passed get drinks? Such waste time. It took us 20 minutes make drive there, 25 waiting, another 20 get home. That's hour evening completely wasted left us starving hard days work. I used work server I could understand place busy staff short handed, basically dead night table top wise. I NEVER go back.
Went past Saturday afternoon, 11/2. My friends I sat pretty much empty bar 5 minutes service. The bartender walked us times didn't even acknowledge there. As walked out, saw bartender phone staff members standing back chatting. We went next door Mad Mex got much better service!
I mixed feelings place. I'll say front: I ever go Sundays football, I would never go reason. It bar I know city reliably find every NFL game televised enjoy Sunday you're Steelers fan. Pretty much every team represented crowd Sundays, disproportional number Bills Redskins fans. The crowd generally friendly, many faces week week. They tend wide selection beers rotates pretty regularly, wide selection doesn't always mean good selection. That said, sometimes get really great beers wouldn't expect find sports bar. Whatever do, don't order bloody Mary, they're atrociously bad. The staff almost universally friendly, exception one barback seems always bad mood rude customers (he often takes bartender later day Sundays). That said, wait staff don't seem know much food beers offered, often mis-characterizing new beers tap giving wrong information things menu. The food mediocre over-priced. When two us go one game Sunday, drink 3-4 beers order entrée, generally end tab $80-90 range, depending we're drinking day. In city almost universally accommodating vegetarians, place decidedly not. They veggie burger actually pretty good, it's decent thing menu vegetarian eat (there also grilled cheese sandwich veggie sandwich, bland point tasteless. It's like eating plain bread). They 4 entrée salads, every one meat defining ingredient. They don't even beans could decent veggie nachos. I know, it's sports bar, I don't want eat veggie burger every Sunday 17 weeks. It gets old. Fast. Upshot? In absence new sports bar opening up, we'll back next season, then.
To honest, I think one worst bars entire city. The food sub-par, even bar food, service awful, especially game. I enjoy good sports bar, I think thing I hated place people frequent there. It's quintessential Shadyside bar, equipped doughebag bros went fraternity college Jersey Shore bimbos pine them. The last time I went two guys throwing outside bar sidewalk. I fully admit subjective review, bar obviously scene- I still like place all.
Unfortunately, service given ruined overall experience Buffalo Blues. We sat put drink order. My husband excited amount beers tap. Fifteen minutes later still without drinks, saw server trying hunt bartender down. Once bartender finally started working drinks, realized keg beer husband ordered tapped. We sitting booths right next bar instead bartender telling us could make another decision get drinks soon possible, waited waitress come back tell her. Then, waitress came back apologize simply said pick different beer one. Anyway, long story short, took way long get drinks never recognition staff issue. The restaurant seemed poorly managed subpar. We back.
Watched bartender serve guy beer visibly intoxicated. He swaying circles chair next me. I told manager told "that guy crazy, I've seen much worse" I guess makes ok. Made paying customer leave one beer.
I've Buffalo Blues times Happy Hour, met daughter last night Happy Hour specials advertised web site. First clue: Happy Hour promos mentioned bar except Yeungs Wings (which looking for). We came close leaving beer draft list, decided stay disappointed daughter's choice already gone although still ilsted. The food awful, service worse. Maybe busser clean table removing dirty dishes--our table sticky mess. The service: one beer table time. Next round I saw two beers go three-top, removed sent bar, poured glasses refilled brought us. Someone else's food brought table, fries came --lukewarm---but wing order never went in. So got garlic parm wings tasted like old overcooked chicken way crispy greasy taste. We ate two each, told server didn't want them. She offered take off, told wasn't necessary, took 1/2 price Customer service gesture. Still, Happy Hour bill 1/2 eaten fries, barely touched wings, 6 drafts total $45 dirty table. At least place quiet--there empty tables everywhere. I think we're done here.
Wings overpriced. And quality bad. They tough greasy. The staff pleasant experience expensive sports bar.
I end coming frequently I would like due Trivia night Wednesdays. Unfortunately every time I wish I somewhere else. Their claim fame wings, consistently worst Pittsburgh. The sauces forgettable, consistently come cold, cost $11 10 (forgetting wing night obviously). You'd think could least wash cold beer whatever room keep kegs must window unit air conditioner. Service normally fine, place always dirty hot hell. I wouldn't recommend... head next door Mad Mex literally anywhere across Highland Ave. bridge.
This go-to place curing hangover. I don't know Chinese buffets day long night round round, trick. I also like come I go grocery shopping nearby Trader Joe's everybody knows it's bad idea go shopping food stuff empty stomach. All favorites here, veggie lo mien, string beans, mac 'n cheese, crab rangoon, hot & sour soup, I haven't seen dan bing (egg pancakes) awhile them, world peanut sauce. Another thing I miss creamed spinach... I yet see dish Pittsburgh buffet go outside city staple among Chines buffets. Another star got knocked lack fresh fruit dessert table. Canned pineapple mandarin oranges always carry metallic taste comparison real thing.
This place horrible, I got eat like 5 mins, everything salty gross.
This average Chinese buffet. The food bad, impressive neither, plus cheap American food. The food little greasy even American Chinese food standard, stomach complained soon I left place. To me, that's no-go signal. On hand, seemed non-buffet counter next-door, perhaps food would better there.
I think 2 3 stars accurate joint... The chicken quality meat lightly sautéed sauce blah. It's nice place sit Chinese food local options. It's last resort Chinese food area. Prices absurd!!!
Absolutely horrible. DO NOT GO HERE. It's like $11 dinner isn't bad Chinese buffets BUT 2 little rows food. And bad. The chicken chicken broccoli small looked disgusting. The sweet sour chicken looked like drops hard, fried batter. The general tsaos chicken soggy smallest pieces chicken. Those basically options. Plus corn shrimp, brown green beans, salad bar, egg roll..so bad. And waitress gave us bill stood got card paid. Will never go again. Don't go.
Not really update much plea Yelp community. If needing pet supplies live Point Breeze/Shadyside/Squirrel Hill/East Liberty area, please PLEASE consider stopping supporting store. With new PetSmart (or Petco?) open street Borders used be, independently owned store lot pressure survive. Given prices different, please give place shot. I'm super anti-chain stores, I AM pro-independent stores (does zero-sum game?).
Made appointment 3:30. They completely forgot I coming said could start car ten minutes done hour. Came back hour later see car spot. They said would take another two hours start work. Completely unhelpful unapologetic.
I came flat. They said couldn't repair tire cracking edges. True cracks, hairline cracks superficial. The diagnosis done examining exterior, I discovered, sufficient adequately judge cracking bad enough--you actually take tire off. Coincidentally, four tires light cracking therefore four tires would probably need replacing. Hmmm.... How convenient Monro? Well, even I give benefit doubt tire cracking, pricing tires ridiculous. My tires, warranty, would cost $500 get replaced crap tires (that's warranty credit applied). Oh wait, could make deal in-house tires even crappier $480. How I know crappy? I looked online. Guess else I found. Both sets tires significantly cheaper according Manufacturer's website even including installation, balancing, disposal! So no, thank you. I don't want pay $500 get cheap tires car. Fortunately, tire would hold air hours I drove another place. They fixed flat problem $20. Guess cracking wasn't bad all.
I knew I needed new tires alignment I ordered tires ahead I could in-and-out quickly possible make class. Showed noone ordered tires said they'd split difference different brand. I little irritated agreed thought going bad decision coming (I'm town); however, I pleasantly surprised service. The mechanics noticed car's bushings causing problems took awhile offered little extra discount much appreciated. Overall, took 2 1/2 hours, front aligned, bushings replaced, two new tires, oil change....cost $606. So, I still believe little pricey guys great I definitely note overall difference car.
Ah Monro, "45 minutes" actually 2 hours running time post. My car lift tires employees smoking cigarettes laughing. I can't even escape I wanted to. At least turned heat waiting room. Not like it's November Pittsburgh anything...
I wish way hold corporation accountable crimes society.
Every single time I go drive-thru I don't get straw. I don't know keeps happening. Every time. Even reminded.
I don't expect much fast food restaurants. But I expect spoken I paying customer. I went drive-thru location and, taking order speaker, one said word me. There different person window, neither said hello, total is, fuck you, nothing. I don't think I've ever encountered miserable bunch people. Maybe they're upset heroin operation shut down.
They literally SLOWEST fast food restaurant I ever to. We tried going drive-thru TWICE BOTH times left someone says "hold one second", you're still waiting order 10 minutes later!! Do go here. There one right street faster!!
Going new mechanic get car repaired shouldn't rank public speaking first dates, usually does. Well go visit Tim Walter's. They guys Walter's friendly, trustworthy, treat respect. They small shop call ahead need major service, else going find mechanic actually suggests way save money repair
We excited go casbah hearing good things locals gone mad Mex, truly great TexMex food. despite trying optimistic, really left unimpressed. here's breakdown: cocktails/drinks- list unimaginative wife's cocktail neither refreshing, strong. beers offered great, one flat: 3/10 gnuti- somewhat tasty rich, well cooked chunks lobster, however nothing I'll remember tomorrow: 7/10 octopus- list ingredients fact Mediterranean restaurant makes think would light fresh w salty kick prosciutto. seemed cooked prosciutto and/or brown sugar overcooked, heavy lumbering dish even fennel could make for. big disappointment. 2/10 halibut- fish well cooked, dish generic, exciting offensive, forgettable. 4/10 Casericcha (sp?)- really standout. The scallops cooked well chock full crab. It rich. Nothing preparation special, wasnt spicy green pesto name red pepper somewhat misnomer, pure weight fresh lump crab makes dish 8/10, even pretty high price pasta $35. Dessert- milk sponge cake- small fairly dry, again, name "sponge" one would disappointed expect moist cake. 3/10. service- service fine, amazing, seemed like waiter little busy higher prices food. although ambience porch nice, seemed hard time regulating temperature, various times sweat building brow, throughout meal. 5/10 total: 30/7=4.something given price, good everything looked menu disappointment anticipated greatness, I'm rounding down. big burrito shooting 50% (props mad Mex), curious see rubber match.
My husband I used go Gab eat time, would always take towners here. That last time went something we've never done walk out! My omelet cooked runny, I asked cheddar cheese got american, husband ordered medium rare hamburger got burnt paper thin patty. When told waitress sent cook gave us attitude total jerk. He wanted put omelet microwave. If I wanted microwave omelet I would gone burger king.
I would give solid one star. Let tell experience... I walk nasty glare one waitresses seating table covered advertisements woman throwing menus us walking away. The waitress sweet old woman. She nice, hard hearing unattentive. Here's I ordered: Two egg whites scrambled, links, Italian toast, half order home fries. Here's I got: Two scrambled whole eggs, Italian toast, home fries. I addressed missing links waitress asked I still wanted them. I starved point said yes. I heard go chef ask them, woman behind grill screamed, "For what? Do slip? Where it? Where say links?" considerably nasty tone. The eggs mediocre, home fries unevenly cooked (mostly uncooked potato chunks, practically ash), links tasteless I stopped eating soon I recognized I full, toast lovely. The prices ok, I'd prefer college student's hungover cooking coming back here. Update: 30 minutes leaving I got vicious headache. 500 milligrams acetaminophen later, headache gotten worse, new unpleasant symptoms come along, I may contracted food poisoning. Update 2: I food poisoning. 100% definitely food poisoning. I haven't eaten anything pretzel rods nutrition bars breakfast since 1pm day before. I obviously haven't eaten since. There's actually place I could contracted it.
Trash. If you've got time explain 2 minutes you're busy take to-go order, you've got time write order start making it. Guess wasn't busy, Carnegie Coffee Company street.
So, I wanting try place time. I never disappointed big burrito restaurant, I guess there's first time everything. I ordered softshell crab, three others party. It awful. It mushy inside, though hadn't taken gills off. I made fried softshell crabs (yes alive, yes I cut faces off), I'm stranger prepared taste. We bites told waiter bad was, didn't really anything it. Anyway, I'm never going back here. Sub par best, go ANY big burrito restaurants.
Walter's SO helpful daughter's car misdiagnosed another garage. He talked us options phone (we're 300 miles away) helped us find solution. Two thumbs up!
I live New York City I extremely regret venturing awful city. This worst fucking experience I've ever wine room. I standing waiting table 15 minutes past time.
I normally try avoid using shops Manordale Tire Delmont, case I really needed within walking/busing distance home, I went limb, checked Car Talk's Mechanics Files, went Walter's. The fellah I met really friendly, even took car drive passenger's seat help diagnose problem, something I'd seen anyone before, I'd say it's definitely great customer service. He kinda suck driving stick, though, car's tough one drive. I little miffed repair scheduled many weeks future, I needed bearing well, riding parkway daily bad bearing doesn't feel safe me. But time came, car done time, I didn't seem problems afterward. I feel like something little wrong suspension getting car back, I think unrelated: I driveshafts, one ball joints way out, I think crapped shortly I took Walter's. I'm going keep going Manordale, place wasn't bad.
If I could give Walter's automotive 5 stars, I would. I called Tim around 8am brakes making awful sound (I know nothing cars). He said usually takes weeks get appointment, I wanted drive would take ride diagnose problem. I drove over, took one look car found problem. He didn't room right then, I dropped 2 days later morning I back end day. Before I left, noticed expired parking passes covering back window offered take me. Great customer service; I definitely back future car issues.
God hate eat n park. Only reason gone salad bar u cant find decent salad bar city. Just every entree iv nothing rubbish, except maybe cheesteak. Only go u little kids
Poor service door. I walked ignored. When I walked worried lack pies case seating customers. In fact person entered attended I even acknowledged. I mean, I'm skinny person long shot, I'm standing front hostess podium, I expect noticed least. When I finally seated things went little smoother. That might I opted salad bar didn't anyone bring items there. I really expected better location, especially since basically next door home office. There line mad rush get here, I baffled.
Possibly worst dining experience I've had. My husband I riding bike trail Pittsburgh decided grab bite eat since location right along trail. We noticed many tables open patio requested sit outside. It rather busy inside waited patiently 20 minutes turn seated. The hostess took us table inside restaurant. Not wanting rude, I asked putting anyone outside reason... She said person took name didn't indicate wanted sit outside (however, I watched write "patio" next name). We led outside told sit ever wanted... Because still basically empty... Finally happy seated, waited another 10 minutes waitress come. She asked ready order meals drinks did. It took another 10 minutes get drinks quickly drank thirsty riding. We able get refill got food since took 40 minutes time ordered it. The waitress came back one time done eating I asked I could talk someone long everything took seem interested. No apology. Nothing. She simply said sometimes aren't told someone seated outside. Maybe would explain initial wait terrible service clearly knew there? This Eat'n Park joke. Extremely slow service rude waitress top it. The food ok, paying meal made feel like I robbed. A group people table next us walked waiting 10-15 minutes waitress acknowledge them. Even woman table asked waitress could order drinks, went inside ignored them. Whoever manages restaurant ashamed!
This worst restaurant waterfront. From second I walked door one acknowledged sister least five ten minutes, I thought weird busy. The manager, standing close talking another employee looked briefly us, didn't smile welcome us, turned continued conversation. We finally get sat booth hostess sloppily wiped off, left crumbs seat left old trash sitting table. We sat booth ten minutes waiting someone come wait us I finally decided enough enough left. My sister loves Eat n Park every time I enter waterfront store I'm severely disappointed. I've manager cook two busy restaurants Oakland six years I know I'm talking about. I never let anyone stand doorway like that, I would wait waitress could get you. It appalling see place become. I never go back place again.
The waitress extremely rude . On two occasions I went rudeness 2 older wait staff. Not sure about..?? The first time lady friend mine order Buffett watress tried charge me..then proceeded argue me...lol..this morning.. another older last kept rolling eyes every quetion I had...lol...NEVER GO THERE AGAIN..
I cannot sing Tim Walter's praises loud enough. I taken car 5 years, I always leave new experience attesting awesomeness. If think might something wrong car you're sure is, stop by, he'll usually take break he's working get car drive little bit give opinion. Then, diagnoses car, he'll explain like you're idiot, he'll make sure understand what's going on. He's incredibly honest cares customers. For instance, I tire needed replaced didn't stock. He told much would cost tire ordered long would take come in, called another shop see asked much charging it, sent would cheaper faster order it. The price difference like ten bucks, I wasn't emergency I'd rather give business. He's awesome.
Good cheap food. Horrible service. Had wait 15 minutes waiter even acknowledge us. He really rude never gave us napkins forks. Our appetizers came drinks. Didn't get refills.
Salad bar looked old. Dry food, mashed veggies, etc. The girl usually come in. Ashley waitress...FANTASTIC SERVICE!
I heard Walter's great reviews yelp. They steer wrong. I went shop asked appointment leaking oil, secretary said didn't one couple weeks. Walter work asked couple questions, asked I could bring next morning. The next morning! I did, Walter employee lifted took look truck. Literally seconds found simply botched oil change, tightened cap, brought truck down. He even topped oil, I believe. All this, said "no charge that" I went pull wallet. I shock. As side note, Walter staff also approachable. While employee worked truck Walter, fellow mechanic (?), I talked various things. I recommend Walter's brother lives Pittsburgh, go Walter's car trouble I I school. I recommend Walter's highest degree.
Perhaps crowd less harsh, I feel like location Squirrel Hill consistently better despite slightly lower rating. I've three times - twice Wednesday night around 5 Saturday around noon. From looking pictures, food doesn't seem bad, I might unlucky Wednesday evenings, times I've ordered, food completely unsatisfactory. The first time, sesame pork chop tiny - definitely worth nearly 10 dollars (I take SOME presentation account well, food looked thrown together plate). But I great salad bar make it, managed cram 6 plates salad I'm college student trying maximize nutrient price ratio. And plus side, waiter, Kevin, friendly, even comped HUGE piece pumpkin creme pie particular reason. I didn't mention anything pork chop I satisfied salad bar, anyway. The second time, I ordered chicken broccoli alfredo, absolutely disgusting. I could see oil droplets entire dish (and I understand alfredo creamy, oily dish, ridiculous), chicken slightly burnt, THREE pieces broccoli. In dish called "chicken broccoli alfredo!" Honestly, I've never sent back food knows chefs would respond, oh well. On plus side, waitress (Aly Ally I think) absolutely lovely. A lot energy, smiles, attentiveness, course, I tipped well. The place packed Saturday noon, I issues. I'm sure cuts pies though (whether they're already sliced waiter/waitress quickly), carrot cake I considerably tinier pumpkin creme pie! Perhaps they'd anticipated enough?
Every time I come location I disappointed service, food, cleanliness and/or wait. I don't understand HQ next door location step locations. This visit salad bar notably missing items, soups salad bar practically empty watery. The restroom dirty. The coffee stale. And steak salad ordered menu browned head lettuce "steakums" looking meat. Further, I salad bar, employee presumably manager discussing another employee always late able effectively job also complaining patrons putting serving spoons back upright position use. I don't think I come back location. The location Streets Run Rd Clairton Blvd exact opposite location. I take business there.
I recently went Eat N Park HORRIBLE experience. The food sub par seating, want call that, made butt hurt weeks. I hard time sitting right almost week half. How restaurant proper seating paying customers? I shouldn't eat sub par food booth feels like home grizzly bears. Oh, don't get started I asked wine list. I enjoy nice glass red wine I indulge eat buffet. Trying eat "fresh" pineapple wine breaks heart.
My experience subpar best hostess didnt even offer take coats. Our table terrible sat hard cusioned like material hurt bottom "waitress" offered us water taste like bottled spain like asked beginning. Our evening became even nightmarish one could ever hope for. We asked fresh tilapia stuffed creme freshe waiter looked us like foreigners something. So settle chicken fingers. And went restroom pass horrendous monstrosities mutated chicken wasnt even one bathroom people offer towel colourful company. end toweling blow dryer. I still tipped blow dryer inserting silver dollars slots. Overall never see take business Applebee's.
I somewhat disappointed I didn't find I looking for. This fairly small Marshalls. It didn't look like store received worst items around, don't appear lot diversity like many Marshalls I patronize. Will I return? Yeah, I will. I one item mind I looking didn't look many things.
Shhhhh don't tell anybody!
Probably unnecessary add another 5 star review page... But I can't help it. Called I noticed strange problem car perceptible driving around while. They told bring car road test next day. When I went in, I mentioned car still warranty dealership wanted charge $150 "diagnostic" could determine whether (a) actually problem (b) covered warranty. After driving around 20 minutes, Tim determined definitely something strange going on... told take back dealership tell I driven car local mechanic clearly something wrong covered warranty. How much I charged this? Not. One. Dime. Such pleasure receive great service also treated kindness respect. Would recommend place anybody heartbeat.
It's hard enough finding good mechanic period. But find one that's friendly reasonably priced unheard of. I've loyal Tim last 4 years he's never let down. If there's one complaint it's things sometimes take little longer expected, minuscule "con" ocean "pros." At one time, I needed new flex pipe put exhaust, Tim recommended I go neighboring shop get exhaust work done "it would expensive I it." This something I've never encountered. A mechanic recommending another place business??? Do favor give place business. Your car might commission days, comfort knowing you're swindled absolutely worth it.
Extremely rude condescending phone. I felt unintelligent belittled speaking businessperson. Personally, I believe working customer service least attempt amicable potential customers. Unfortunately, I hung feeling like major inconvenience. I work company thankfully found friendly willing help alternative repair shop Liberty.
Lord love honest mechanic!! I traveling 3 months knew I needed get front & back brakes done & I knew least 1 motor mount bad I bought car 10 months ago. Stopped one chain places 3 months back I started trip get oil changed 1 new tire. They kings of: "Hey could come second? I wanna show something." They said stuff wrong car quoted estimate $1705 repairs. I got morning googled "honest auto mechanic Pittsburgh" Walter's place first place came up. Tons 5 star reviews. Gave call. They come got front back brakes done me. (The place said brakes rotors bad 3 months ago.) He mentioned motor mount. The place told 4 bad. 2 bad. So I ended Walter take care I find someone honest, fast & efficient I'm sticking them. What $1705 bill turned $726 bill. I'll take it!! Nice honest people & fast service.
Locked house 830pm, called, arrived 930pm took 1 minute open, cost 120dollars. I used different company open car door 10 pm cost 50...so....
Plays well Tazza latte around corner! The quiche divine biscuits I imagine mom would made actually made biscuits. Two words: YUM-OH! Cannot wait return Steel City I partake desserts.
This best little bakery Pittsburgh! My favorites include: key lime cake, biscuits, strata ham sandwiches! The line always door, won't disappointed!
This AAA office Monroeville, since here.... Had go complete car registration! Not pleasant people - smiles greeting & others line (and I 3 different times well hour.) They also shove throat membership. If doesn't work, try scare w/ it. Or fact you'll save sooooo much money member. And, certified notary, won't go verify VIN... make go thru hassle seeing mechanic AND returning office 2nd time!
You'll get better service proverbial "Bureau Motor Vehicles." Visited today help son secure title/registration car purchased. The office opens 8.30a nobody actually started helping people 8.45a. And ONE staff person -- visibly ill (which later learned hangover overhearing conversation co-worker). ONE person working among dozens desks workstations. Granted, Friday morning, still. Just one?!?!?!? I understand need schedule people peak/off-peak demand services, NOT I've come expect AAA. It like ghost town there. And nobody smiled anyone else. Not all. A (small) bunch unhappy people trapped soul-less bureaucracy. As I said above: it's WORSE Bureau Motor Vehicles. When left -- 9.35a -- "serving" customer #4. Unbelievable. AAA used provide service. Not more.
option zero stars forced give one. 7 weeks ago wasted hour time $5 process title transfer. BTW, east liberty/motor square garden-their parking lot awful! makes paying customers fetch tokens park? 7 weeks later, title? odd reason, local AAA offices dont post phone number online? instead, get generic 412-363-5100 number call ctr "transfer" local office? naturally, get automatic voicemail. naturally, return phone call. CANT WAIT AAA calls renew membership. complete incompetence. might well deal penndot!
If I could give negative stars I would. After review, I'm writing president AA action taken correct disservice location, I never AAA member again. (been one since 1999) I recently moved TN needed transfer title register Dodge Ram PA. This process costly regardless go, adding $36+ every transaction makes AAA expensive. I'm willing pay people deal inconvenience me, AAA made worse going DMV. Each every clerk location incompetent, uneducated, aloof. I know, I've dealt LEAST dozen. Go DMV. For simple transaction, I've return location 7 (yes SEVEN!) times, still resolved. They've forgotten request title lien holder, issued wrong plate vehicle, neglected inform steps required state... I mean seriously, would pay $36 EACH visit, get wrong. Go DMV! Why return unhappy, might ask. Well begin process one branch, cannot transfer branch. (We went Monroeville transfer wife's car took 30 minutes, ONCE.) Go Monroeville, cancel AAA membership go DMV!! Oh, 30 minutes? that's dream... I'm waited 45 minutes 3.5 HOURS East Liberty AAA. Prepare take day work... nay, WEEK order complete transaction facility. Go DMV!!!! It 5 months since I started process it's still air. don't know I still need do, happy keep charging figure out. Save hundreds dollars weeks worth lost wages GO TO THE DMV!!!!!!!! Yeah might seem sterile slow, least aren't serial criminals. It'll like waking bad dream, instead reoccurring nightmare East Liberty AAA. Oh, think harsh review... Call number, 412-365-7196. 9 times 10 rings rings.. I timed 30 minutes I got answer (with apology). If AAA, you'll know I'm calling. It's constant ring background NOBODY answers.

Worst experience. Slow, rude, unhelpful, completely clueless. After one hour talking 4 different people, I absolutely closer getting driver's license renewed.
Not bad experience I keep telling myself, that's I'll stick to. Confusion sets soon near place, step foot door. Do I park street, I pull lot confusing signs? Take pick doesn't really matter. Careful crossing streets get here. Once inside, confusion continues. Signs somewhat lacking really don't directly tell need go. Getting lost easy here. Majority time, escalators maitenence, making much harder navigate building. My soul purpose coming get license picture taken. At usual locations DMV, walk in, take number sit wait. Not here. Without sign indicate need stop reception desk make DMV portion floor, turn around wait line. And wait, get hear receptionist make snarky remark can't read sign...MAKE IT BIGGER AND PUT IT WHERE A PERSON, dog, CAN SEE IT. Thank god I get picture taken here, I might lost it. Sidenote: Is me, would place better used market buy fresh meats produce in. Or indoor shopping center?
This place sucks! Not pay routine DMV services AAA member, wait literally HOURS seen. Complete waste life. I hate place passion!!!!
I never write reviews... piece work. I usually blow overly negative reviews (read prior reviews place) assuming disgruntled customers looking whine something. Well place completely incompetent getting title transferred state. Weekly calls 3 months, temporary registration expired week don't know I'll legal plates. They promise call back right away, takes week. It frustrating folks incapable completing simple job. Go somewhere else. Anywhere else.
Going AAA bit worse average DMV. The woman working front desk nice, sum it. The guy processed registration patronizing slow. He also made mistake required fixing fact. I can't say I'm enamored peculiarities Pennsylvania licensing laws.
It painful give place 5 star review, I think back bad times I've here, it's I terrible mood I walked didn't get better. When come here, prepared wait. I routinely wait hour. Seems ridiculous? It used piss I bring magazine. It better AAA membership go get discount, DMV area. It convenient that, validate parking. I recently bought SUV state. The transfer could easier, even messed mileage written idiot I bought from. Can believe actually tried sell truck Bill Sale?? Yeah, um NO! (I'm justifying calling idiot). You get pretty much everything done here, even get license renewed. Do go weekend. It zoo. And don't go lunch hours week. Around 2 afternoon weekday done well. Just patient treat employees respect, get one piece maybe even good mood!
I member 39 years. I got flat tire Miata fortunately first flat tire 8 years since spare. I called AAA service follow-up appalling! I called flatbed truck first dispatcher rude unhelpful (and I waited long time get rude treatment). Finally agreed send someone put air tire. I said don't come flatbed truck, use. He said I would get priority service flatbed air sufficient. Air sufficient, guy called flatbed I waited wait. I called AAA told since I home, I wait longer. So air tire wasted time. Finally someone came NOT flatbed truck. He said better flatbed. It getting late. He forgot release emergency brake towed garage brake on! He also damaged front fender towing car. I called next day. I told someone would get back within 1-3 days. No one gotten back yet. I wait forever talk one. So I complained email decided share too. Horrible treatment.
Extremely bureaucratic employees. Bad facility, even without trash room. The waiting forever many people line, also result low efficiency staff.
Stay away Nichole..... She provides terrible customer service location. I never seen rude person county far. Seems like don't wanted take care customers. Very poor
Thomas Darby I never stay Extended Stay America due fact October, 2015 awful stay! Room cleaned one time asking three times would cleaned. There absolutely nothing supposedly full kitchen, 2 wash clothes, 2 hand towels 2 towels. We take used wash clothes towels front desk every day receive fresh ones. The toilet ran heater didn't work decided leave. We charged booking Hotels.com put $100.00 deposit. For what? Never stay there!!!!!
We traveled Pittsburgh wedding chose stay extended stay. The photos nice, reviews decent. Front desk staff friendly room spacious laid well that's it. The room non smoking, clear one ever followed rule. It stank bad smoke I came home, I wash clean clothes smelled smoke well. Not mention allergies full effect. The bathroom inconvenient get of. The door opened 1cm toilet wedge door sink. Breakfast pathetic. There row fruit row store bought muffins couple things coffee, that's it. I'll sure spend money elsewhere next time.
Solid food so-so setting: Location, location, location. Upon entering, past dining space, yes dining space get hostess. This confusing disruptive guests. This walkway leads another door hostess waiting. Inside second room nice modern bar backlit walls upscale booths. Myself date however placed first dining area, indoor patio we'll call it. Others iron tables chairs. Perhaps nicer area larger parties events? Needless say right next entrance date night constantly offset guests entering exiting. Food great service far main entrance confusing I could see echoed guests entered.
Let start.. The service little sketchy, beer cold food amazing. I would recommend paddy's anyone.
If I could give place less one star, I would. I idea gave place high reviews must either place time travelers back day place might sucked. The decor tired grimy, place reeked smoke, bartender/server surly, put mildly. We went Saturday night mind try Irish food. Apparently, luck. I've always thought secrets restaurant success actually stock food people eat. He told us ordered "pies". No chicken pot pie, shepherds pie, etc. So, gamely tried order things. We placed order. My wife, example, ordered Irish stew came back 5 min later telling us even things several people party. At point wife picked third option, ham cabbage, told "they out". At point, realizing food place crusted menus, asked pay drinks left. They actually gave us flack enough put debit card. In short, unless like dinner side disappointment depression, I'd probably avoid place like plague. Speaking plague, I suppose thank Mr. Surly inspiring us walk out. I two bathrooms house would've hard pressed accommodate several violently ill people once.
The delivery driver mistakenly rang doorbell, confused 133 113. Rather taking step back analyzing situation, begins accuse wife I ordering refusing pay pizza. The driver gets cell phone rather calling number given order placed, begins call bosses starts threatening felony charges. So I take initiative ask fine upstanding gentleman phone number order-er was, phone neighbor discover mistake. Rather thank sorry, speeds (breaking speed limit block) reach destination 50 feet away. I would call complain, based reviews, clear owners care Carnegie it's residents, pretty well known around town awful food is, would pointless boycott place I'd never order anyway. Do favor order ANY establishment town.
It's Black & Gold. (Only brunch menu now, though!) And Tofu Tenders. And vegan baked goods My Goodies. My complaint regarding vegan milkshakes. Sorbet milkshake make.
Some worst pizza I've ever had. We used coupon paper 2 topping 8 cut Sicilian. First pizza wasn't even cut through, sad attempt cutting uneven 4 slices inch wide, others 4" each. The toppings scarce, used mini pepperoni put maybe 8 whole pizza. The onions huge chunks mushrooms straight can. The worst part though thick doughy crust tasted like fishy sourdough roll. I'm serious... It noticeable made wonder dough bad weird reason put fish sauce it. It gross. We also ordered steak Italian hoagies. The veggies old wilted, dressing either. The Italian deli meat clearly bottom line generous. The "steak" (if call that) greyish instead brown looked like processed meat chopped pieces. No flavor seasoning texture reminiscent spam. It bad I ate 1/4 tossed rest. I ordered past always disappointed. I thought I would give another try since I'd never ordered Sicilian pizza there. What mistake. I never order again!
Food tasty, though portions waifish hipster types. Location inconvenient I would recommend people walking night stretch Penn. Service uneven i.e. bad, even place practically dead. I can't really speak coffee, though good tissanes(however getting refill hot water another thing). ************** Okay I won't change rating, I take back I said food. They changed menu really bad. We Buffalo Tofu sticks ridiculously dry. I Thai Peanut Tofu Wrap tasted like peanut butter. I don't understand point Mockamole? It's made peas instead avocado. How describe food... it's took pictures food look made food without thinking food taste. Gee peas green, like avocados?? I would go coffee/tea whatever hang out, food. Okay one decent thing menu artichoke dip. I completely disappointed.
Solid Milkshakes Falafel - block house
I taken things loved "reasonably priced" are. My resent experience horrible family I never go back. The business run way past. I took dress needed taken back around neck. When I went pick even ready find next day I charged $60. My family I coming years never ever spent anything even remotely close $60 worth alterations. My mom came pick two things right total $25... Not prices extremely inconsistent I finally got dress neck still way loose zipper didn't go way I pin dress wear safety pins wedding. I able get money back apparently "it wasn't fault" told worry it. This probably worst business Carnegie. Is possible give zero stars?
I'm sure took wife & I long find place! Before visiting Quiet Storm I didn't realize entire menu vegetarian, shouldn't much problem even fans meat. I ordered "Maelstrom" I would call Mediterranean Quesadilla. The flavor subtle, delicious. There plenty menu options looks like restaurant really it's part support local community. The complaint I would temperature also got bit cold sitting door... winter. Finally, remember bring enough cash cover bill that's way pay. I disappointed Quiet Storm definitely getting back place next time I'm Pittsburgh.
I love LJS agree, service decent here. I tried piece kid's chicken (I ever get fish myself) pleasantly surprised find white breast meat (same chicken texture chick fil a). A little grimy dining room, bathroom handle broken 8/2015... It would nice made A&W-LJS as-is still works me.
I love LJS, I write review regarding particular location. The inside dated appears poorly cared for. It smelled like burnt fish walked door. It took 15 mins food, I figured gonna fresh...negative! The fish old cold fries soft. The corn lacked butter. I didn't care onion rings boyfriend said Coleslaw tasted spoiled. The chicken planks hushpuppies things edible. Service wasn't bad - nice people. Too bad whole bunch flies started flying around dining area prep area, ruined appetite.
By far worst unprofessional dentist I ever experienced staff busy watching soap operas TVs room instead cleaning gave filling deep could understandable son pictures delivered Hawaii stop 3 times pay show whole staff must nice 14 year old go Hawaii moms dime patience wait see happen I oral surgery tooth removed put filling deep abscessed tooth result I wouldn't recommend ex girlfriend someone I hate three months extreme tooth pain I deal lack care follow even I called asked advice follow simply could care less even offer reschedule appointment prescribing vicodin antibiotics recommend go license pulled!!
Take me; avoid place cost. The time I go I starved don't energy cook get edible food. And I kicking myself.
I used order takeout every month so. The food tastes average price good. It's typical low-end Chinese place. The last (and final) time I ordered I happened picking order health inspector allegheny county health department making rounds. While I waiting food (which took much longer usual) inspector pointing violations. He also requested copy certificate man behind register unable produce. The inspector looked like I crazy waiting food despite obvious poor conditions. As rest place - it's always kind dirty inside. The carpets FILTHY walls match. There always children's toys scattered floor owners children always there, careful trip. The workers seem like nice people trying make living comes cleanliness Don Don lacking.
Maybe I jaded vegan town; Quiet Storm's food menu bores tears, I use salt mediocre cooking home! Their coffee isn't great either, given choice, local La Prima favor. Tears. This vegetarian restaurant East side town, oh close me, I cannot stand go there. Desperate times call toast tea served sad server resides within depressed little dining room.
I came two friends prior visiting Apis Meadery next door past weekend. I ordered General Tso's chicken, friends ordered sesame chicken, crab rangoon, another appetizer (egg rolls?). They ordered combo less meat, I ordered one more--the names similar, I found confusing. The food took quite come (~15 min.), I'd suggest calling ahead you're rush. While waiting, woman behind counter yelled someone phone Chinese, guy came pick food delivery (probably person). To honest, I'm much fan Americanized Chinese cuisine (I lived Singapore 3 mos. visited Hong King Japan); it's awhile since I've it, dish reminded why. I don't care overbearing sweetness thickness sauce, I care pre-cut meat dishes (I like cut meat, thank much), flavors textures don't much me. Having said that, friends claimed best Americanized Chinese fare they'd PGH (and live Squirrel Hill!), you're fan cuisine, take consideration. If nothing else, meal provided us much-needed food absorb alcohol mead, I appreciated.
We visited Don Don Chinese restaurant Carnegie back Entertainment Book coupon buy one dinner get one complimentary dinner. We ordered 2 regular dinners. At end went check pay, owner refused honor Entertainment Book coupon offered fruit cup instead, refused. The food acceptable, refusing accept Entertainment Book coupon acceptable . Needless say, never returned.
I took sick cat charged $$$$ blood work never called results. I chase results finally spoke different vet one examined cat. He said cat "absolutely hyperthyroid". They said cat's problems behavioral rude dismissive concerns. I finally took cat another vet diagnosed hyperthyroidism. I'm trying medication I hope illness hasn't progressed far. Otherwise I'll put sleep. Don't take cat here.
I must glutton punishment, I keep finding hungrily returning Quiet Storm. The menu slightly changed, longer cash only... This time "8th Ward" inflicted extreme disappointment. Not sure 8th Ward supposed mean, I forever associate dry boring place. And I thought getting party platter! This appetizer sampler included THE WORST hummus evaar; I near positive forgot add garlic, lemon, salt tahini chickpea paste described "garlicky" menu. Sooo wrong. "The Butter," another WTF name, also dry bland. The salsa good! And plenty dipping accessories, many really, given smallness unappetizing dip portions. At point, I've tried vegan options QS offer luck I've B.Y.O.B. Go figure. I wouldn't care much much tease place I didn't REALLY desire comfortable neighborhood place eat comfortable food comfortable view cute waitress writes fiction. And frustrates others seem recognize culinary (I shutter even calling that) mediocrity "the best" vegetarian restaurant Pittsburgh offer.
I like food Denny's meals served pricier restaurants. My favorite Bourbon Chicken Skillet. Even though isn't advertised gluten-free, doesn't ingredients containing wheat- chicken, potatoes, broccoli yummy Jack Daniels sauce. Both Eat n Park Max Erma's gone downhill past years, food Denny's gotten better.
I'm sorry give stars...15 minutes cup coffee, waitress flitted around...waited another 10 minutes 25 minutes sitting menu closed..I left. Coffee water untouched. Waitress busy telling customer next booth daughters almost wedding. Don't waste time money Denny's. Service horrible waitresses worst...food usually isn't great..but I can't speak visit...25 minutes one wanted take order. Ps...Kings great breakfast day...service great...only 1.5 miles road.
This gym, part true. But it's well maintained. It's dingy locker rooms abysmal, basically unusable. There's pretty wide range equipment, enough really go around. If you're free weights, area larger, crowded dungeony (personally I go that, saying). The place must REALLY conservative owner well, TVs play FOX News day long. If ask staff another channel, get around changing half time, half time you'll ignored forced watch bunch awful talking heads tell lies entire time you're trying run lift. Part problem owner cheap paying cable change channel TVs individually. They linked one box only. The place also lets whole ton personal trainers basically whatever want. This means area set aside abdominal exercises, stretching, rock climbing wall (which I've never seen turned used) crowded punch really shape people mostly carrying conversations incredibly beefy personal trainers, hey, trainer getting paid either way, want waste time chatting, don't mind.
I spoke man morning ice covered parking lot sidewalk, business liable customers someone slip fall due negligence business's part. He told good luck I'm liable careful everywhere icy. After two years gym I'm fed way treat customers. He told fed since I gave hard time towels weeks ago (which they've towels since then). They never clean parking lot winter make sure wear boots outside don't crash car. Aside that, gym well gym. My biggest critic (aside rude management negligence) would don't encourage sanitization outside cardio room. There aren't towels spray around weight machines, I've never issue with, I'd hate see happen. I always make sure least wipe sweat marks machine, cause well that'd pretty nasty. It pretty large terms size space anything aside ordinary weights cardio. The workers well they're mostly young don't really care much (the man told I wrong older possibly manager owner). They tend keep top wash towels even isn't busy, pretty annoying. Their cardio room always Fox News two tvs middle TV sports center regardless else tv. They recently haven't even putting pens games stuff on. Must busy watching 52 inch screen lobby workers cardio room max 32 middle 24 sides probably. If I pay full price membership I probably wouldn't belong here, it's insurance. That said I don't swipe card like people front own. The machine behind counter. One guy always shows myself, helpful first time cause people aren't always around front desk. That said standing behind chatting I would expect since it's job. This gym nothing state art fancy fancy, really need fancy looking gym? Their cardio room pretty massive even peak hours I've never problem getting treadmill elliptical. They actually even two hellix trainers, aren't super common yet. Sometimes things go order take fix them. I've run owner manager one time bathroom someone let sink floor asked I tell guys desk said oh they're useless. This gym makes killing a) classes b) it's convenient c) personal training separate company (warrior fitness). I've meaning sign trainer I always see busy. They seem awesome helpful challenging. Not sure separate yelp page, I would say I've seen they'd bust ass sure!
This review rating may everyone. Amerifit gym many serious body builders work out. This anti-Planet Fitness (there pizza days). This place private personal trainers take clients affiliation Planet Fitness. You pay $5 per day want meet occasionally. What casual person may see upon entering: You hear lots grunting weights dropped. Do intimidated. The folks (men ladies) competitions (usually). The place may seem run (older weights / machines). Do let deceive you. The place may seem small. Again - let deceive you. They smaller rooms / areas. They classes upstairs seem pretty intense (not cup tea). Why 4 Stars: 1. I followed trainer (which means I chose trainer location could work out). My previous trainers great I necessarily like gym (too crowded enough room work out). 2. Equipment variety. Example - Cardio Equipment. Usually go gym, treadmill, stepper, recumbent bike, bike, elliptical) - All one type. Amerifit provides variety machines Cybex. Cybex traditional elliptical control elevation well. They also machines simulate ice skating 3. Intensity - You see people seriously working out. This either motivate intimidate you. It motivates me. I also see folks exercises correctly. 4. The folks nice. All associates I met nice. I apologize serious body builders writing review, I think good secret share. Find trainer, meet him/her Amerifit, workout. This chain gym everything new standard (usually leased) equipment.
I'm mean reviewer, look places I've reviewed, disappointing. The Shanghai style Merlin poorly done. The meat extremely bland, little seasoning. I low sodium tolerance yet I still found fish made bland. The rice entirely uncooked made crunching sounds I took first bite. I talked waitress offered bring another side. It wasn't same. The whole dish fail I don't think I ever coming back :(
I went recent business trip, aren't many decent options West Homestead, I decided splurge company's dollar ordered take-out. I highly disappointed service, I ordered take out. Upon going bar announce I take out, 3 people bar. The bartender back wasn't minutes passed another guest told wait me. After announcing reason visit, checks order (not ready yet) helps tables. No offer water, drink. Another gentleman working bar asked bartender offered drink, stated order would right up. He asked offered water, replied, order going right up. He placed glass water front me. Then I hear name order announced kitchen staff. 3 staff members yelled. . ."it's TAKEOUT" back went kitchen packed up. Gentelman bartender asks female bartender rung yet (she not) After time passed (how long take put food takeout container?) finally put front me. She rings up. I don't expect take piping hot, point wondered even going room. When go eat meal, utensils included. I go find something eat lukewarm food with. VERY DISAPPOINTING experience. Will returning.
Will I come again? Yes absolutely drinks, knocked Ketel One extra dirty blue cheese olive martini outta park. The ambiance nice. Of 4 types reviews I give (awesome, OK, bad get slammed bad I hope improve) I giving heartfelt "bad I hope improve." Our waitress friendly good job. I mentioned gritty redskins mashed potato. We went appetizers recommended. Not good. Seared ahi tuna: horrible flavors mixed rub, prep, tuna wasn't cool inside, chips good, soy sauce wasabi. NOT good. With heartfelt advice, compare Outback's ahi tuna appetizer it's contest. The chef so. (He's nice guy like I hope.) BBQ shrimp: go try Redstone's (Philly) buffalo shrimp appetizer. It chilled, delicious. This appetizer recommended garbage. The barbecue sauce horrible, overwhelmed left unsavory aftertaste clients' palate. Gordon Food Service Sysco BBQ sauce. A real "must-miss". Cod entree OK. The skillet beans firm, mature, need petite green beans. Potato skin grit mashed. Why 1 star? The price close Capital Grille, far cuisine. I hope spruce up. The place nice.
The service mostly friendly I disappointed meal. My meal way cooked. The soda flat carbonation needed changed I felt like inconvenienced server asking new ones. Overall, I thought mediocre I expecting prices.
Terrible service. Food unremarkable. Waiter disappeared 45 minutes serve larger group due staffing mismanagement. Saved tip discounting meal I complained. All all, crude unpleasant dining experience guests. Not repeated, never again!
Terrible service...terrible food...this place smells like rotten wet wood
The boyfriend I went year ago (early 2012) recommendations sister. I salad - iceberg lettuce covered essentially oil salt. It disgusting I couldn't eat it. And Iceberg al la carte salad? nothing else? ugh. We appetizer stuffed pepper. It even hot pepper, cold meatball flopped top tasteless. For dinner I pesto. Essentially noodles swimming green liquid. Not ton flavor either. The boyfriend lemon chicken. His broccoli ROCK HARD - like wood! And chicken dry. We make better food served. After paid got it, I don't even care try again. All good reviews amaze me.
I restaurant twice disappointed times. I won't go back. The first time almost 3 hours. It took forever order forever food come place empty. When I complained manager rude tried blame us taking long order. It made sense, could order waitress wasn't coming table? After arguing ended taking $6 $200+ bill. Ridiculous. If I would never returned. Unfortunately family decided go tonight. Again took long time get food. My food cold bland, kids food cold. My husbands salmon burnt crisp sister law took one bite trout refused eat claims disgusting. The wedding soup bread good, that's it! My drink sat empty throughout meal never got refilled even I asked. Bad food, slow service rude managers. I'll pass place family decides go again. Not worth good Italian options around.
We stopped Papa J's last Friday night (8/1) round drinks. There 7 us altogether eaten another restaurant earlier evening. One member party walked bar let know sitting couches along wall, fairly busy night. In short time there, man behind bar looked turn away without saying word notifying anyone else. He turned waitress approached service area bar asked could server take drink order. She said "yep" abruptly turned walked away. At point, asked see manager came minutes later. When friend told occurred, manager said "What want do"? My friend said "An apology would good start" whereupon manager looked back said "Get don't come back" ???????? Are kidding???? My friend well traveled frequently stays higher end hotels dines quality restaurants. He screaming belligerent way, shape, form; simply informing manager occurred. That said, left went back 131 East, previously eaten. The service fabulous, meal drinks creative exquisite. There new restaurants opened Carnegie late. Papa J's longer game town. Obviously way simple complaint handled management. Appalling!! Do favor frequent restaurants within walking distance Papa J's. They understand concept customer service.
Man place gone hill. My husband I went couple weeks ago. We salads pasta. Both verge inedible. With single glass wine, I felt downright robbed $50 price tag. Seriously, I could easily made jarred sauce boxed pasta home. Classico better. And service pretty absent make even worse... seemed knew terrible didn't want deal it. Seriously, I'd rather eat OG.
Food NOT GOOD all! My husband & I ate couple weeks ago first time. I ordered salad & basil pesto cream pasta & husband ordered spinach & feta pasta. The salad huge plate spring mix (nothing else it) WAY much vinegar dressing. My lettuce drowning vinegar. My pesto pasta flavor (did taste like cream sauce me) & pesto runny/watery & way much sauce enough noodles. My husband's pasta even less flavor mine. We ate quarter food & couldn't even finish it. We took home & bad I didn't even eat leftovers. And I hate wasting food!! Plus prices expensive amount food get & course poor quality. Don't waste time eating here. There much better Italian restaurants Pittsburgh.
Well, Papa J's officially priced budget. We ordered 2 salads gorgonzola pine nuts total $35.98!!! $18 per salad??!?!? Really?! I stunned I saw bill! It's lettuce, cheese, pine nuts! $18 / salad?! Totally crazy!
Our pizza cold drinks empty. We going back.! The waitress started attentive, slowly slipped away point things became frustrating.
Talk overpriced. $18 fairly basic pasta obviously frozen chicken chopped it. The latter terrible, thin flabby rather unappealing. The pasta ok, sauce. The desserts pretty good. But honestly, $10 dish whose price inflated.
I wrote letter Papa J's, receive reply therefore I share experience online. Tonight friend I dined location. We seated bar area sidewalk, requested great weather happy hour specials. Our server took order gingerale, fried zucchini appetizer, side salad, wedding soup , eggplant rolotini chicken piccata ( correct spelling). We thoroughly enjoyed bread & wedding soup. The side salad rather bland unexciting, lacking flavor & texture. The Spring salad consisted leaf lettuce, single slice tomato one black olive. I would expected additions onions, peppers, cheese, cucumbers, croutons, carrots like. We enjoyed fresh air waiting appetizer, growing concerned would arrive close meal, asked server ( bartender ) appetizer told us forgot "put in". He offered put point, advised us meals would soon. We decided wait meals forgo appetizer looking forward to. The main dishes acceptable, outstanding. The eggplant tasty well prepared. The Chicken Piccata flavorful, expected. The chicken seemed steamed baked. It signs coated sautéed rich golden brown. The chicken pale white. The sauce simple lemon flavor, lacked depth would resulted browning chicken. I tasted garlic shallots. The sauce lacked famous tang usually supplied capers, absent. No pasta served chicken. The side vegetables well cooked, buy lacked real flavor. The would benefited roasting would produced rich savory taste produced extraction natural sugars. Once meals finished plates taken waited another 20 minutes check. The server seemed concerned television rather customers. The total $43 change. I would expected salad soup would removed bill error putting appetizer order, offer made I saw manager come around check customers, customary. I hesitant go back restaurant recommend anyone tonights dining experience. I hope feedback beneficial business.
Had dinner friend. My friend ordered veal brought sausage. The waitress extremely rude. He never get correct meal. When We talked manager, answer .,"well want fire waitress?" Too many good restaurants area tolerate bad attitude!
We visited 11/15 party 15. While I know party 15 overwhelming, call advance reservations. Thus, allowing proper staffing. We arrived early headed bar. The bartender greeted us quickly took great care us. When time reservation seated immediately. That efficiency service took turn worst. We sat 20 minutes server came table. At point, said I'll grab water bread. Another 10 minutes go members party went bar grab drinks server vanished (still water bread). She finally comes back table bread (no waters) takes drink orders (about 40 mins sitting table). Next thing know, nice gentleman name Patrick NEW server. He really stepped service commended. However, ordered veal stuffed banana peppers arrived cold. We also ordered "incredible white pizza" incredibly cold. While Patrick stepped service entire experience fairly terrible. Not front house manager come check us. This second time I've visited 2nd time I've disappointed. Also, I wrote restaurant received response.
I never write reviews New Year's Eve ruined due awful experience was. The food subpar lost cause time got it. For $50 person terrible. The menu small, select menu. I got shrimp veal veal dry. But real issue.... Last night NYE went dinner intention going celebrate after. reservations 7pm made weeks advance. We didn't get food around 930 didn't get check another hour. We hour half even got bread. Everything asked "I'll get little bit." I ordered drink 3 times never got it. I don't understand busy select menu. You'd think they'd handle things. How don't salads ready made cooler bread baskets prepared reservations made weeks ago? Anyway, ended missing reservations events planned dinner. I'll probably never go back again.
Worst service time. 2 hours pizza repeat waiter 5 time throughout night. Then asked bill given bill 3 times amount bunch items there. Place total joke.
Combinacion! This place shit real. Where's Patron at??? (b)
The food ok Complaints sitting bar watching male bartender stand around literally nothing woman bartender bust ass made uncomfortable night especially knowing pull tips returning shame two manager notice
There zero people aside friend I.
Fish water comes hardware related things. I mean I know swing hammer push button start machine, stuff...meh. I've really gone pick paint, I'll focus that. I feel bad lady works paint counter. Each time I'm always seems line customers wanting base paint tinted. I don't believe ever time I could walk counter paint mixed me. Give woman hand.
What happened East Liberty Home Depot? It used "go-to" place everything DIY, longer. I stopped yesterday pick nine items, basic home improvement supplies: cabinet handles, tension rods, quarter round molding, etc. I came away NONE it. Everything wanted OUT OF STOCK! When I asked I could order delivered store (to save shipping costs) I told items I wanted "qualified" delivery store. "When items restocked?" "Don't know." "Would possible get items delivered another store region?" "No, 'messes with' inventory controls." Oh, I told I could haul sorry butt Monroeville stock everything I wanted plentiful. Really? The staff I dealt could cared less helping me. Maybe holiday (New Year's Eve). Dunno. Don't care. Customer service ebb flow based day/date. The East Liberty HD used shelves full product plenty choices. And staff helpful eager engage customers. No longer. It appears company given location letting die slow painful (for customers) death. VERY disappointing me.
I made rookie mistake going Home Depot sunny afternoon Saturday. Enter pure chaos. For starters, parking lot worst. Small spaces large trucks squeezing in. Seriously, thinking made micro spaces? There people every direction aimlessly pointedly Cris-crossing every aisle. I WAS able ask two different employees help, grab them, they're busy. The check-out even insane. Two lanes actual employees self-check out, really shouldn't even thing. You try scanning yard stick. Yeah, right. This particular Home Depot located beyond Penn Circle East Liberty ('Slibery) one-way street. Don't come relaxing shopping trip. Be prepared insane parking lot wars lots chaos inside. But live East End, need supplies, probably best bet.
Tried using online order store pickup hopes increased efficiency. fail.
Terrible cashiers Very rude This homedepot terrible job Never
OMG chocolate espresso milkshake MMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmm
I "curry plate", though actually big bowl. It enough two meals! And tasty. I usually like bigger pieces dishes like totally fine minced good. I added picture. The service seem little poor considering us three tables place lunch. We wait least 10 minutes check another 10 minutes standing cash register pay person behind counter talked phone. It also little sad pita I paid $1 small (and included something like curry plate already). The slaw slightly strange chemical taste still good enough eat due fresh vegetables [and I didn't really order it, came dish].
I really, really wanted like restaurant. Hip, quirky, vegetarian/vegan. Lots owls kitschy deco. I eat meat occasionally, vegetarian buddy visit, thought would great choice. What's love, right? Well, starters, service. Our server really nice, lots reviews, suggestions alternate ideas order... service mind-numbingly, ridiculously slow-- place half empty. Plus, even two requests napkins (which provided begin with, available empty tables around us) never received napkins all. I'm really messy eater, come on! Maybe part problem expectations? We kicked things "firesticks" appetizer-- really tasty quesadilla-ish things. After that, orders (I thai salad) kind of... boring? Strangely spiced? I feel like bar set high app, none entrees met expectations yummy veggie goodness, dining companions agreed. I also ordered cup mac & cheese, awful. You know reheat elbow mac & cheese microwave, cheese gets greasy/gloopy noodles stick together? Well, exactly THAT, powdered garlic sprinked top. Really. I made leftover mac home paid $4 cup that. Learn mistake. We planned order milkshakes, too, server spent much time black hole something time finally returned, we'd completely finished meal least 15 minutes. For $4 (and probably ridiculous wait) per milkshake, decided hit The Milkshake Factory East Carson instead.
Why vegetarian restaurants think need "fake" meat, I understand. I primavera sandwich ok, patty roll perplexing "mystery meat" get elementary school cafeteria. My sandwich came boring pasta salad tortilla chips bag. Otherwise atmosphere fun, wifi free ask password.
So first went brunch, I idea vegetarian restaurant. That's unpleasant prospect face hard night drinking, time idea brunch ever occurs me. But then, grim Spectre Laziness appeared asked, "Do really want drive another place? Just look you. Your wearing shirt wore yesterday dude." The Spectre Laziness dick, also right. And surprise, nothing I bad all. For brunch options, meat eaters find potatoes eggs cornerstone breakfast, seitan substitutions bad say, grim Spectre Laziness point slovenly appearance. I think biggest surprise place that, though nothing particularly jarring palate, nothing really stands amazing. In Yelp terms: it's kind 3. For hard core vegetarians night, er, mid-afternoon town, it's probably blessed change meat based culture Pittsburgh pretty famous for. But I'm willing wager meat eaters become converted vegetarians this. Maybe TOO good job substituting meat items. That said, make back another time lunch I vegetarian gyro. My friend said best: "What's fucking point?" The service always sweet, times waiters curiously, nay ominously spacey. Even wasn't crowded substantial flag downs polite doleful eye contact would needed. If you're area looking for...this type thing, really don't many options eat it.
We went Thanksgiving dinner; called ahead check vegan options, person end little grumpy matter, there's little open day, little choice except make sure I ate big lunch earlier. I ordered Thai salad, probably vegan item menu - really coleslaw peanut sauce funky chips. I also ordered grilled vegetables. Both good, amazing. The beer selection really bad (I mean, dive bar stuff), however slightly pricey wine selection redeemed place, great red white. The service pretty good, I simply can't recommend going due poor selection vegan items.
You don't vegetarian vegan enjoy Quiet Storm. I've breakfast lunch haven't disappointed. The menu good selection vegetarian vegan dishes specials change daily. The issue I service. On particularly crowded Sunday I asked twice coffee refill waiter never filled cup, even checked food came out. I know busy, tables seemed fine. Despite poor service, I returned, haven't problems since.
Whoever gave place 4 five stars must minds. Had dinner July so. I looking fish place town again, figured, reading positive reviews improved. Yikes. Bad decision. The staff seemed put anyone all, seemingly puzzled menu. I watched two bartenders trying figure make strawberry daiquiri 5 minutes, admittedly entertaining. I ordered chowder crab cakes. The chowder basically flour stew potatoes. I'm guessing may clam two somewhere, couldn't taste flour. The crab cakes definitely frozen, made blue crab. If you're going offer Chesapeake crab cakes, damn well better real deal. Zero flavor dry hell. Stringy, Asian crab definitely pre-made. Terrible. I don't like rip spot, seriously weak restaurant. Don't know I expected western PA offer goods, Chicago well, Pittsburgh. Best analogy- Olive Garden seafood
Not impressed all! The first time ordered drinks server forgot drinks second time ask could drinks. I ordered, white frutti di mare 24.49 I got 2 scallops 3 small shrimps. Our bill $120. 00 Way pricey 2 scallops pasta.
Very disappointing Easter dinner. We eaten twice last year service impeccable, food delicious, piping hot. I realize Ruth's Chris sold Landry's, change good one. We made reservations five seated promptly, drinks brought. A good crab dip salads enjoyed all. Then main courses arrived. First let say something occurred table seated us size served first. Finally four five meals brought. The hush puppies fries cold, seafood ok, coleslaw warm sat warming light. The planked salmon good hot. Five minutes later $32 Easter special came out. One tiny lobster tail salty stuffing. No discernible seafood stuffing. 4 small dry cooked shrimp blob salty stuffing, large blob cold dry hard mashed redskins. We shocked. Our waitress, actually wonderful felt terrible knew something gone wrong saw table served us us short plate. She spoke manager several times asked talk us. When finally told sorry I told sooner could fix it??? He rude us. Offered us free dessert. I told couldn't possibly think I going pay inedible food. He begrudgingly took price 2 less expensive entrees bill. I looking forward holiday meal weeks. His poor management skills rude behavior ruined holiday. I never go back. Stephen Gray, manager Mitchells Homestead, ashamed treated us. Landry's needs look restaurant expect people keep coming. Those prices acceptable fantastic food service.
They tofu tenders, akin vegan buffalo wing. I can't put finger it, really doesn't appear much terms sort secret cooking technique, holy crap, I can't get enough them! I 3 orders 2 days, since it's tofu & greasy wings... it's legitimately healthy meal/snack. The Cheesy Snake -- vegetarian cheese steak -- made vegan cheese, it's pretty slammin, too. The slaw tastes like liking brick salt, coffee etiquette -- pouring old pots other, half-full pots -- leaves bit desired, overall, I know it's one places Pittsburgh serves vegan food that's pretty awesome.
Despite 3-star rating, I think I coming back give second try. I got smashed potatoes seitan, cheese, aioli. The first bite OK--the aioli didn't quite suit taste, everything else worked pretty well together. However, 20 some-odd bites dish, flavors getting repetitive mushy texture started gross out. I got half-way eating dish so-so aioli became much me. I couldn't take another bite. However, wife's apple panini delicious. I would probably eat I came back. The cream cheese, cinnamon (from bread?), apple worked together glorious harmony. On strange note, eating, camera guys came started setting looked interview. We asked staff going on. Apparently someone filming submission/application reality show. "Oh cool," thought. "What reality show?" asked. "Not sure, something Golf Channel," replied. HAHAHAHA! I thought watching grass growing TV boring enough. Now they're making reality show it. In end, gross aioli inexcusable me. Otherwise, I'd probably go 4 stars. I still plan come back give another shot.
Seriously. This place PHENOMENAL. I've never gotten something I didn't like. I'm vegan favorite thing place it's people would typically think veg. food. It's comfort food best...big yummy burritos...scrambles...drool inducing drink selection. Its got really cool vibe prices aren't bad. Only complaint (if any) several servers seem little zonked out...like don't really give shit. But whatever, go there...NOW!
I posting review deemed important enough keep. Funny within days I contacted customer service Landry's asking contact information. I gave twice one bothered contact me. Stay far away place. Extremely high priced average food. What disappointing Easter dinner. We eaten twice last year service impeccable, food delicious, piping hot. I realize Ruth's Chris sold Landry's, change good one.

Yes, I know. I'm probably one people rated place two stars. But let explain. My friends I wanted try place high hopes. I haven't heard many vegetarian/vegan places Pittsburgh I expected awesome vegetarian food. However, get go, host absolutely terrible. He look us eye overall awkward. There obviously room restaurant four us "look back" see room. One servers eventually sat us clearly empty table could picked ourselves. Our first host came back, reiterated thing server told us, never gave us menus. I go way ask menus five ten minutes seated. To fair, assigned server nice. She friendly approachable. But course, food came mine cold. The potatoes hash I ordered stale, old cold small accompanying serving bread. Also, utensils weren't given us food served. I know I may sounding like little bit snob utensils expected food arrives. Not completely biased, rest party decent food. It wasn't anything special. Definitely worth $12 brunch. Needless say, I coming back place.
disappointing. patron restaurant/location since opened.....usually dining month. last visits fine, great, fine. today not. restaurant half full, one person. food--- friend ceasar salad: staff didn't know anchovies were, therefore none. served room temperature. chef's special penne light alfredo sauce crab shrimp. also served room temperature. scallops stir fried vegetables. scallops, too, room temperature seared one side, all. manager offered redo meals, accepted. shrugged shoulders said didn't know else could do. scallops better 2nd time, penne watery, crab invisible. garnish cheese first time, 2nd. penne mediocre best. service--- probably worst service i've ever there. server seemed overwhelmed, apologized continually us every table nearby. maybe part reason meals hot first time. never get refill iced tea. ambiance--- place starting look tired. tables showing age.... surface hasn't kept up, finish long since worn used parts. sorry see place go hill. many memories better times. may ever go back. looking new place area.
What happened place? It use best around; within last months gone completely hill. The quality completely gone, portions smaller, prices higher. From I read it's company change, could make place go wonderful horrible quickly? The server even tried pushing diners club program us!!! Who would pay dining program place!?!? That's right, I said pay! The company wants pay membership! Why loyal customer pay rewarded LOYAL??? Why would anyone even pay lousy food? The place even kept anymore. The atmosphere become dingy even dish $30 + meal came felt grimy!!! My silver even wrapped torn linens! Where management? How allow expensive meals go dirty dishes? Where wonderful night gone? I use look forward week night here. Now I don't even want drive past! Even staff miserable anymore. Everyone use pleasant welcoming, seem run well, miserable. I've come back 3 times hoping experiences flukes, unfortunately place use be! I'm sad knowing favorite restaurant gone!Do favor don't waste hard earned money here. You nickeled dimed everything receive nasty frozen sea food dirty dishes ratty linens, miserable workers.
Worst tofu scramble ever. Days old, cold, hard, inedible. Sent back time wait another dish. I can't even believe server, let alone "chef" thought appropriate serve. Brought 2 year old along, get high chair, I'm able would nice asked server needed one.
This really hard review write, simply I cannot life find words explain food. Lackluster, no, really...Mediocre...no....Pedestrian/average/common...huh uh. Just 'eh.' It wasn't awful, terrible even bad, wasn't great, good even fine. It just....edible, I guess. We started shrimp dumplings happy hour menu BF got seafood gumbo. I thought gumbo decent; said 'eh', however agreed dumplings 'eh'. I got something called market trio, came creole style rice, corn, crab cake, hunk salmon 5 shrimp. It wasn't terrible, inedible food, just....not good. And $28 I wish I would gotten bowl gumbo. The thing seemed flavor rice. The BF got crab lobster stuffed cod, again, bad good. It lemony-buttery sauce, didn't taste quite lemony buttery somehow. I know stupid thing gripe about, I hatehatehate restaurants charge necessarily high prices pop. Soda, cola, pop, call want, never $2.50. I usually drink water lemon, I headache, I ordered coke. $325!! And BF works restaurant, I know pop costs pennies! I see $2-2.50; people drink glass glass stuff, $3.25 simply ridiculous. Especially food kinda sucks. And I read reviews decor classy. It's like it's trying classy, real classy restaurants know its' classy. It little like over-priced, under-flavored Red Lobster without kickass cheese biscuits. But food sucks Red Lobster, always fill delicious biscuits.
Mitchells great place get fresh seafood vs national chain places. I 6 times never bad meal. It little expensive worth it. Chillean sea bass $35 line places it. Talapia $27. The atmosphere reminds seafood places ocean.
I yesterday ate one booths bar. I many times last night disappointing server bad. I sever 34 years still complain since I'm business must mean something. Granted I understand busy unfriendly unattrntive . We never got bread asked threw table kept walking never stopped one second even check us even introduce himself. When I would go ask question something gone I even got finish. It upsetting go 82 year old mother treated poorly. Last time I'll ever sit bad booths that's way service there.
Quality food low shrimp scallops bland overcoat came 10 minutes first dinner served I think left heat lamps. My wife's dish came completely wrong Manager charge us two meals still seem expensive.
I've found service pretty terrible. Servers pretty careless taking care simple things friends similar experiences. The food really pretty good, overall service sucks, well, makes hard enjoy tasty meal. Sorry Storm, need improve this.
I gave two stars didn't actually eat food. This simply customer service review. I'd like give benefit doubt, food probably excellent. Sadly, hostess incredibly rude uninviting, mood ruined even met server. Upon arrival (party 2), I asked see menu. 20 minutes later still acknowledged. 4 groups came came we're seated stood there, looking toward hostesses expectantly. After quite time hostess stared me, I suppose waiting greet myself. No 'Hello' 'may I help you?' Finally curt 'have helped?' responded 'no'. The hostess brusquely grabbed two menus, didn't ask whether expecting people, didn't ask whether wanted booth table (every patron offered preference) stated FOLLOW ME. She literally threw menus booth passing by, didn't stop await us take seats, didn't introduce even mention server anything. Simply threw menus table left, word spoken. We didn't remain long enough meet server, unfortunate I really hoping nice meal there. I return.
We really looking forward acclaimed restaurant scene hometown Pittsburgh, retired Arizona 6 years ago. We remembered Mitchell's Fish Market excellent seafood, well (surprisingly) steak. Wow, disappointed!!!!! The near-empty parking lot 8:00 PM Friday first clue. The misunderstandings reservation treated accusingly front greeters arguing second clue. The lack availability first 3 choices made menu third clue. The shoe really dropped food came. Both blackened cod, steamed vegetables side asparagus hollandaise ALL cold, dry hard. The cod portion tiny. MY partner's fillet beef ordered "medium rare medium well pink" black outside, dry, cold well done. Others party six similar experiences plain tough batter-dipped greasy fried fish one cold, dry, small portion "fresh" fish another. We told place changed management past 5 years. In light poor quality food upscale prices, Mitchell's Fish Market deserves fail close.
Awful, Gave 2 stars cause wait staff nice. Was Saturday night. It warm (too uncomfortable enjoy meal) told management air conditioning unit broken. Can't afford pay extra weekend someone repair replace unit? Not even ceiling fan sight. Same old menu options. Ordered tuna medium came rare. They redid time way overcooked. Ate anyway. Are chefs inexperienced can't tell something rare, medium, well done? Anyway, haven't years I remember I avoided place.
We enjoyed place first visit. Today made mistake showing late Sunday afternoon. Nobody front. A uninterested waiters wandering back. We finally sat bar bartender disappear 15 minutes. We finally walked go elsewhere. Bottom line: you're read customers close place dinner service begins.
Very bad purchase experience. I bought shirt hole covered rolled sleeves, denied request return it. I angery never shop chothes anymore.
After consideration, store deserve 4 star review. The Old Navy product pretty weak recently, isn't store's fault, severe lack customer service doesn't help situation. While shopping Friday, I one maybe 3-5 people store. I would practically walk sales associate even receive glance smile. No one working seems give iota whether product sold. To avoid inconveniencing associates, I taking Old Navy purchases online future.
It's like Old Navy anywhere - well maybe one San Francisco, always packed - ws pre Thanksgiving, quiet storm Black Friday. I picked one bargain weekend - $2.45 pair flip flops (it preparing snow outside).
I enter every sporting goods stores soccer player, runner, sports fan, reviews always skewed towards particular areas. With said, probably worst Dick's location I've ever to. The selection limited soccer gear, must testament lack local customer base seeking soccer gear. It's mostly low-end youth gear, too, makes nearly useless adults even teenage soccer players. The staff location always really nice, though, it's closest location live, I still end going quite bit running clothing needs (of course, usually leave empty-handed don't we're looking for). They quite extensive fan gear section you're looking support local Pittsburgh teams, store doesn't overall inventory necessary considered "good" Dick's location.
This older Dick's Sporting Goods location. Come basics don't expect find huge assortment would find DSGs throughout city. I wandered around 15 minutes one evening anyone approach me, asking I needed assistance. I also found small child back store playing dangerously one elliptical machines, something parents store's staff addressed. Overall, I'll go I need sporting goods basics would rather drive little nicer location.
It shop save.
I wanted love place. We started Caesar salad, asked dressing homemade told yes however I number homemade Caesars deff not. They also topped one crouton? My meal chicken breast bone broccoli. Chicken came literally size chicken nuggets broccoli basically raw cold. I three stars bread actually really good finances meal also mediocre. He eggplant rolitini opinion weird flavor. We would go back try pizza I wouldn't suggest wasting 50 bucks meal.
Literally walked waiting table 15 minutes server site. We never even offered drinks. It embarrassing! Others came us ans serves. Not us. Your food may good, service deplorable! Just rude.
The food Quiet Storm usually excellent unique. It lots options vegetarians vegans, specialty drinks (coffee, tea, milkshakes, etc.) tasty! However, service poor. I probably 6 times, time issue. The waitstaff usually seems confused doesn't appear care customer much. There never time I've eaten order come correctly. It's either wrong, something forgotten. There's also usually apology. Today waiter forgot numerous things (why don't write order down?) even gave us bill another table! As much I enjoy food, I say I'm getting tired service inadequate.
I've decided I stand Emmert Dental. They unprofessional, rude clue they're (behind desk). I going back I nice things say them.
You know it's bad McDonald's gets 1 star review...I mean, seriously: none us expect anything fancy go McDonald's. The whole point going McDonald's indulging not-good-for-you food go busy life. In case, I wanted small meal/snack wouldn't cost much stuff Kennywood would. I hadn't even eaten McDonald's eight years so. And I quickly remembered why! Forget fact McDonald's food isn't great. We know it's great. The problem added insult injury giving worst customer service ever addition good food. For starters, I quickly discovered drive-thru ABSOLUTE slowest line planet Earth. You certainly won't getting fast food here! Then, I FINALLY placed order, finally got window pay (because course I spent lot time waiting people front even get orders), young woman took card, swiped it...and didn't say another word. I waited thinking printing receipt - nope! Eventually - whipping phone sending text two - realized I still told go next window food. Whatever, I figured, forget receipt; I pretty sure moved orders couldn't print receipt anyway. On next window, I given food drink...and I proceeded quickly discover gave straw reason, layered Big Mac such: bread, bread, patty, patty, bread. ...seriously, one even mess up? I give one brownie point fries really actually pretty good...but worth wait trouble. I concur reviewers: skip place. Completely. Just keep driving. Anywhere else better less waste time money, people slow you'll spend time waiting food eating it.
By far absolute worst Mcdonalds World. You pretty much rest assured that, long wait drive thru, order definitely wrong. Calls owner go ignored. Rice Enterprises majority McDonalds South Hills. They gone hill quality, service cleanliness. The owner problem.
The worst dental office I ever been. No one beat it!!! You avoid time.
Worst McDonald's ever. Waited 16 min drive thru- finally drove without even ordering! Horrific.
I admit, first time I hate here, I absolutely hated pizza. And I think I expecting something completely different I got. Latina Pizza different pizza shops. Instead round thin crust pizza, pizza square, thick, doughy. The crust really good, get pizza here. It's homemade sauce. And family owned place really pretty inexpensive. The nice thing shop right next Kennywood. So usually around dinnertime leave park walk order pizzas drinks. No lines, waiting tables, outrageous prices. It's time recharge, sometimes feel like going back park, times decide go home.
Would dogs teeth cleaned ! This place one worst dental offices I've ever walked . Enough said
I've never posted yelp review before. This meal horrible I downloaded yelp app I could warn others stay away! We ordered food Capri since going voodoo brewery. We ordered cheesesteak mayo Italian calzone since person working talked calzones. We ended cheesesteak heavy mayo Italian wedgie, folded pizza full mayo onions. No sign Italian meat found. No marinara sauce. It inedible. We ended walking kfc instead. I want leave zero star rating, yelp won't let me. So get undeserved star.
Ew. Okay, worst pizza ever, it's pretty far list pizzerias...and that's sad, considering I quite literally live across street it. This go-to pizza destination I'd rather pay delivery charge eat pizza. The sauce way sweet (like, Papa Johns sweet) isn't enough cheese. There many decent pizza delivery places around settle this. The thing I enjoy Pizza Perfectta sign hilariously claims, "Excitingly flavored!" Personally, I wasn't orgasm mediocre pizza. Maybe wouldn't tempted language I would less pissed them. Two stars let borrow paper cups I moved apartment hadn't unpacked kitchen stuff yet. Without I may travel half block north grab different restaurant. Thanks, Pizza Perfectta. Oh, here's little Italian lesson you: it's "perfetta," "perfectta."
Eat risk. The service terrible, staff seem generally clueless, management inclined blame staff mistakes, there's sense FAST fast food. When came, half menu board still breakfast, 4:30p. The thing going food hot tastes like McDonald's should. Then again, franchise owned Rice, I've come take terrible service MO.
My expectations McDonalds rarely high. But one still fail spectacularly...that takes something special! The cashier took friends's order, promptly ignored me. I force front cashier opened register wait person BEHIND me. I waited five minutes gigantic order included precisely one kid's meal. After watching two people ordered handed food, I asked mine was. The manager started yelling cashiers "serving orders" didn't food. But neither cashier anywhere near controls, manager one serving food customers clearing boards. The manager rude giving order. She didn't make sure I everything ON MY RECEIPT, never even decency apologize I felt I getting poor service. I've eaten various McDonalds restaurants 30 years. I've worked one location. I expect bad days, bad moods, occasional mistake. But I yet decent experience store. It remain place I avoid unless someone party needs avoid illness low blood sugar. Perhaps I go back racially biased service Steak n Shake instead!
I able give McDonalds 0 stars. If award worst McDonalds around Pittsburgh would take cake. It blows mind too. Being Waterfront manager could make place shine there's polishing turd. P*ss poor service, filthy dining room, filthy bathrooms, attitudes workers... If I give real world example "Misery loves company meant", I would take make order food sit eat. If McDonalds depended one good would went business years ago. I've gonna dozen times 11 half times worst experience worst food I ever McDonalds. I'm sorry harsh know what, I'm sorry. This McDonalds ruined best days everyone needs know stay away. I'd rather second Chik Fil A Waterfront place. Stay away. Far far far far away. Don't even look place, cover side face keep driving. There's nothing see here.
I wrote review right I bought bike. I would like update reflect experiences I've BBB. So, first all, one shifters bike turned defective (not super-unusual Shimano short-reach shifters, also totally shop's fault -- things happen). Since covered warranty, BBB switched new set shifters, cost me. I bike back couple days, muss fuss. My husband got used road bike Craigslist, brought tuneup. The bike several things wrong it, due shoddy assembly job, BBB basically took entire bike apart rebuilt it, cleaning replacing various worn-out bits. I can't remember total cost this, $100. I would totally recommend BBB, due general awesomeness. I haven't tuneup-related woes people shop, even bringing bike I haven't bought there.
looooong wait, always screws orders. poor customer service. going hire said I go somewhere else orientation.
Worst mcdonalds ever to. Last time went chicken nuggets cooked. People getting refunds wait time long. My daughter asked gogurt w happy meal got apples wait 10 min change gogurt. Soda watered gross. Rude staff doesnt know doing. Will never go back even though closest one me.
I've lot McDonald's time, worst. Service unbelievably slow, frowns around clean. Just skip one better off.
Mmm...peppermint mocha In quest visit every Starbucks USA I stopped yet another location. This one located center circle road -- cache newer part area.
For $10 get 8 inch sub GIANT slice pizza. Needless say, become favorite place order dinner from.
Typical Starbucks coffee chain. 2 things I dont like Starbucks: 1. Ive twice times place dirty, compared Starbucks I in. 2. If use bathroom, give key thats attached nasty bottle. Im pretty sure dont clean bottle every use even nightly. Aside that, good coffee fast/friendly service.
This typical Starbucks. The coffee good store suprisingly dirty.
Got rancho Greek, bad I probably won't go back... Too heavy me...
I'm huge fan location. I think oddly built- small, alley-like front makes difficult get past people way to/from bathroom tables it's busy. And there's hardly tables sit at. Furthermore, people tend clog front way in, makes things particularly difficult (especially winter weather). The staff pretty impersonal be, maybe due high traffic place time I there. And coffee I cold- I'm sure probably bottom batch. I'd probably walk someone else suggested movie shopping area.
This particular Starbucks especially pushy offering extra espresso shots placing order. This never happened took guard. The barista came dishonest unfriendly sell push. I avoid one Waterfront awhile.
I bit disappointed pizza I got. I ordered Milano special pizza, pepperoni, bacon, sausage, bell peppers, mushrooms, olives, tomatoes, etc, popcorn chicken. The order arrived within thirty minutes great. Although pizza tasted decent, crust crispy all, slices pretty floppy. They also skimped toppings bit. I hoping loaded pizza. I'm watching weight--I handle it. As far popcorn chicken goes, salty, even honey Dijon dipping sauce. Probably ordering again.
2.5 rounding places stop bad. First stop Munhall Beer Crawl 2011. It local dive local beers. No microbrews imports.
Any time Ive ever stepped Randys, odd smell immediately makes want turn around walk out. Bartenders dont seem friendly arent regular, expect get weird vibes regulars. With options area, take money elsewhere!
Delivered hotel late day family stuff. Hit spot pretty well. Only wish I'd ordered bigger one.
Justine groomed long haired cat thick fur three times I nothing praise her. My Teddy trusts much patience him. I'll bringing Cat Around Town next week. Looking forward
For someone straddles line sometimes craft-er, store seem vast confusing. There's rows rows baskets bedazzling jewels paper and...oh my...scrap booking! When I want find boring old felt....it's like...where I start? I'm hurry, always, I rush first thing I look employee. No one found. I could call voice would come echoing back. I run rows paper, wood gosh darn scrap booking....no felt! Where I find felt! Where I find employee!? FINALLY, I find one 15 minutes wondering around. She's incredibly nice leads felt. This first time I've hard find help. I tell hard find, tells they're "low payroll" can't one floor BUT HER! In WHOLE store, JUST HER! That's ridic! Not month ago I was, again, slight hurry stood line 15 minutes check out, 2 employees register 6 people per line, I gave walked out. Hey Michael, pick I'm putting down? You're making money costumer service SUCKS....in fact, there's service found!
I frequently shopping Michaels store last couple months since I began taking cake decorating class hosted large baby shower home. The store typically supplies I need cake cupcake baking icing scrap booking supplies. This location pretty average compared Michaels - it's exactly would expect going store. It's large store, it's small store -- average. I enjoy using Michael's coupons shopping. I definitely save lot money! Instead toting around paper versions, I actually iPhone app coupons available use app. My complaint sometimes takes check location. I don't normally problem - usually one two people ahead - sometimes much slower. Today, example, two customers ahead me, one issues coupon. The line began get longer longer, though couple associates lingering front, kept calling someone else. From personal experience manger retail store, linger let associates linger near cashiers without jumping register. Whatever reason may helping customers, still appears rude make everyone impatient....
Great pizza. They sent us wrong bread sticks first (regular instead cheesy), quickly fixed without issue.
They claimed website "the best wings town". As seeker good wings, let tell adventure place. Everything started fine order 24 wings three separate sauces 3 eaters. The wings arrived exactly hour later exact number wings promised side celery. Here's catch...THERE WAS NO SAUCE! My party three decided tough eat wings plain. They were, I kid not, bland I wasn't sure I eating. They literally threw wings fryer delivered us. So realized unbearable plain wings were, called complained sauce. About 40 minutes later, sauce arrived. At point, wings got cold hunger turned unbearable rage. We tried BBQ, Garlic Parmesan Spicy. The sauces average. The spicy sauce weak I should've settled bottle sirracha. The deliver guy gave us cannoli apology....ONE CANNOLI....3 eaters! You get point. But gives chance tell terrible cannoli was. The outer shell soggy filling made gag little. It looked nice, didn't taste great. So 1 hour 40 minutes, 24 wings, 3 sauces cannoli... 3 unhappy customers. The wings mediocre wings I ever tasted. I NOT order wings NOR I recommend fellow wings connoisseurs there. Final verdict: MOST MEDIOCRE wings town!
Stay away!!!!!! Could understand foreign cashier saying, made placing near impossible. Could make pizza save life...
It's typical chain craft store. And let reiterate I'm crafts person. I walked I needed dial rods signs I had. Now chain store I bit upset even though decent selection, amounts one I wanted scarce. Imagine standing different sizes wood hand staring disbelief. And piece wood, price bit steep. I provably come back here, item I cannot find elsewhere. Or I'm lazy drive out.
I'd wanting try pizza place awhile, I received opportunity dept. delivered event last Fri. Overall, I found pies typical PGH pizza style, slightly average quality, hence 4 star rating (my average rating, well PGH Yelp citywide average, 3.5). Jason F. describes elements pizza well, I won't reiterate them. I mention generous amount cheese, sauce:cheese ratio point. I don't recall crust particularly crisp (my personal sticking point comes pizza); however, hand, I don't recall floppy insubstantial, either. In terms overall quality, Pizza Perfectta's pies cut nearby Pizza Parma, offer similar conveniences (acceptance credit cards; delivery). Given I don't order food delivery, I'll stop person next time I'm vicinity Shadyside/East Liberty.
1* Apple map telling they're open 10pm. Just completed mad dash 9:30pm. Yes, I realize I could've called beforehand...
Rude. Rude. Rude. They don't speak English don't understand English. And rude.
Update: Get. The. Italian. Sausage. Pierogies. Holy crap. It change freaking life!
Whenever I waterfront I would eat here. The shakes good, shoestring fries baked beans. The sandwiches small thin patties meat probably want least double. Overall, pretty tasty.
This absolute WORST Steak N Shake I've ever to. The bf I got lost around Pittsburgh 40 min. trying find location top unnecessary 1 hour wait food, food crappily made. It bad waited ridiculous amount time (c'mon, Steak N Shake basically glorified McD's), waiter comped WHOLE MEAL. If compensation, I would pissed pay crappy meal. The bf, hand, upset principle matter... trekked way get Steak N Shake fix (since us haven't since undergraduate days) major fail. I think I'm good Steak N Shake craving long time now... PS. The whole joint smells like major B.O.
This place amazing homemade pierogies! I never eaten anything besides usual Mrs. T.'s potato types boy, I missing out! We stopped one night got potato/cheddar sauerkraut/potato. You buy hot take home cold. There small table outside eat, standing room order inside. They special order pierogies sounded amazing, suggest 2 day advance order those. They said sometimes leftover specialty ones sale, depends day. They also haluski, stuffed cabbage things I looking forward trying next time.
I really like shop. I spend hours walking around getting ideas things either update change around home. All sales associates extremely useful educated. Occasionally difficult seek someone aid may busy helping customers.
Avoid place. You could spend hours looking something without anyone sight help you, see employee walk way half time. The employees nice I get sense it's managed terribly. For amount business would think HD could effort here.
The vet met us short amount time. She rushed, seemed distracted, abrupt. She quickly said seemed like SCC, oral cancer, cure prognosis wasn't good. She left room seconds came back say would get blood work schedule biopsy. After said thought SCC, didn't give us chance ask questions respond. The technician didn't demeanor cat, us clients. She seemed tired, overworked. All all, negative experience. I recommend take pets another vet :(
I disappointed quality pierogies haluski Pierogies Plus. I ordered hot I purchased enough I could leftovers next day. When I got home opened containers, something smelled odd. When I started eat, tasted odd. As turns out, referred 'butter sauce' misrepresentation really is-----margarine, I eliminated diet years ago trans fats fact way cut it, butter makes better product. Sorry Allison B, ain't butter here. Margarine used cost-cutting measure, can't measure up. I rinsed peirogies browned butter onions. The haluski got thrown away. For prices charged products, proprietor well-afford use butter.
Refused take cat, passed away, cremation cause I clinic previously. IMHO that's ridiculous. I recommended anyone ever come here.
We went way way long road trip stop here, worth it. It's one funky little neighborhood spots great job specialty. Ordering little awkward got it. We didn't mind sitting crappy little outdoor seating area--it better getting back car.
Sorry first taste Pierogies Plus. We potato cheese I would like know cheese was? The potatoes tasted bland almost like dried mixed. Not cut tea.
Dr. Caroline Simard wonderful, frequently unavailable see patients appears works part time. If real emergency one lengthy vacations, forced meet another doctor. On one occasion, resulted permanent change pet's overall health. I forced locate another vet I adopted new kitten. Then I recently accepted job overseas, wanted take older cat back vet get paperwork done, I didn't take new vet pay initial visit. The receptionist informed policy handle ANY paperwork unless submitted pet relocation service. When I tried clarify ask another question doctor simply signing health chart, spoke loudly repeatedly saying NO. I understand may burned past, seriously, learn manners, lady. 1. Not able see doctor I prefer 2. Absence said doctor led PERMANENT decrease pet's well 3. Policies engender total lack cooperation stressful time regarding relocation pet. 4. Being treated extremely rudely reception final straw. I mean, inflexible raised voice mere request clarification rule. I don't need anyone shouting me, especially someone I paying, 8:30 am. Thanks, thanks. For reasons, simply worth stress, time, money return. It unfortunate.
I going three different animals. However, I recently missed appointment. I called reschedule talk office manager, Barb. Barb told phone service called day appointment, I use phone full time career I would fired phone off. I proceeded tell phone number said number service. She proceeded tell I allowed reschedule since I missed appointment. I proceeded tell father died four months ago long time customer previous dogs. I disappointed I treated office manager I tears. I going Dr. Gerson mom animals entire life. Some childhood memories office favorite furry friends. It unfortunate rude office manager. I NEVER treated poorly human entire life. From moment I got phone her, nothing rude unwilling help me. Barb, reading this, don't think I enough one year? You couldn't cut long time customer break? My dad punish heaven treated daughter. Those doctors behind doors idea rude Barb customers right I look place animals second home. I hope replace Barb women heart. I look new office I allowed go back I accidentally got appointment time mixed up. Karma coming BARB! I
I like place; single-handedly made hate Pittsburgh little less. In fact, would easy 5 stars wasn't Pittsburgh therefore emblazoned manner Steelers propaganda, Browns fan I...I can't it. I'm sorry. The sandwiches good prepared genuine care attention detail, people friendly prices reasonable. Get soft pretzels, toss 'em microwave eat mustard.
I posted favorable review past, I cannot say much I recommend take dollars elsewhere. They buy everything CostCo mark up. They make Whole Foods look like bargain basement. You would think extra price would get convenience quality. No. I asked products someone would want local store. I told roughly "this deli, convenience store." Well, it's deli want buy cheese molds within week. So, quality/fresh ingredients convenience items sky high prices... It would great neighborhood either deli served community convenience store open late weekends. This place neighborhood support.
I taken clothes Shadyside Valet last six months mixed results. Just recently I given pair pants rain splatter knee third time, pointed dropping time, received back progress made splatter. Although hard define, I also find shirts seem "beat up" times care. They also staple ID tags tag garment dry cleaning, a) bitch pull fingernails otherwise b) shows level disrespect clothing bothers me. A wise man told aren't receiving level service require dry cleaner depsite repeated instructions, time move on. I'm currently looking new dry cleaner.
Terrible dry cleaners! Poor customer service. I gone convenience sake, ultimately, I spend time pointing poor quality returning second third time fix mistakes actually saving time. I made mistake inspecting items counter, I bring back next day, saying still dirty, nerve make pay again. I never go again, I recommend don't either.
Simply awful! I dropped three suits Friday afternoon, person wrote order rude, I brushed chalked bad day. As promised, ready Monday 5pm. I brought home shocked. The backs jackets EXACT SAME wrinkles I dropped off. Furthermore, EXACT SAME crease left sleeve I dropped off. Additionally, smell well. To make matters worse, hung jackets wire hangers without cardboard keep natural shape jackets. The suits custom tailored cheap stretch imagination. I refuse even let touch suits again, let alone article clothing. I read clue rude employee, hindsight always 20/20. The worst $35.00 I've ever spent. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!
They've ruined clothes 2 separate occasions! I would returned I known I went wear I thought "perfectly clean" clothes Shadyside Valet. They Streaky best! Stay away! They awkwardly rude nice way. Also failed even attempt remove stains clothes, asked expressly, two occasions. I took care stains myself. I'm ditching calling bank get refund!That placed cursed! ....Nothing BAD EXPERIENCES!!! I want know I'm "Angry Customer". They really suc!!!! After reading review's I " 1 star" Instead 2. Giving one crime itself.
I dunno everyone's negative issues place is, times it's always great. Friendly staff, solid service, never disappointed, don't detracted negative reviews, always good me.
Very rude condescending. They way really getting skin within minutes trying talk them.
We went get two new back tires. We pulled lot start hearing loud grinding noise. We took back they're saying there's something wrong breaks. But didn't problem left lot! And talked boss big boss "there's nothing it" said. We used hard earned money $300 get something fixed something broken wasn't touched it... Don't go here. And another lady complaining service too. Get together Midas!
My experience similar Amy R. Midas installed tie rod INCORRECTLY. I course didn't notice (who looks tie rod one installed). When I state inspection done, neighborhood mechanic found problem fixed (which I pay for). I complained Midas said I neighborhood mechanic put car back together drive car Midas re-install tie rod properly. Since I would pay mechanic labor anyway, Midas already shown didn't know properly install tie rods, option made sense me. My car working fine (thanks neighborhood mechanic) like pulling teeth get money back Midas. It I complained PA Attorney General refunded money I paid faulty tie rod installation. Like Amy R., offered give free service (I think may alignment). But safety important I'm never letting touch car again. The Attorney General tried get Midas give money I pay neighborhood mechanic (which I wouldn't pay ineptitude). However, Midas refused (the owner called liar, way), AG merely mediator can't force Midas anything. The AG did, however, suggest I file civil claim magistrate thought I good case. I chose filing fee $94 potential upside $200 (with downside I lose case $94 addition $200 I already paid). As aside, I took car work back. My spare trunk (you lift carpet cover). I don't expect put everything back exactly put blindfold threw things messily possibly could. I've NEVER experienced lack consideration professionalism. DO NOT take car Midas!! They faulty work jeopardize safety. The unprofessional discourteous. They place NO value customer satisfaction. Take business elsewhere!!
I called find I needed appointment I told "just come take you" I gave keys said come back three hours. Guy also trying push credit card seemed upset I said I didn't want one. Three hours later I came get car transaction processed ready let go till I brought The paper said something broken last oil change. That's funny last oil change one I personally checked oil meter broken. Furthermore I week later I found car's belt system broken. The guy fixed said someone must've broken although I don't agree it's something could've seen. Not coming back even though it's rather convenient
Crooks. Brought car tire rotation&oil change, specifically discussed oil change $19.99. Got call later trying sell alignment, brake jobs, expensive oil ($55 !!) - usual crap sell people think idiots. Refused those. Came pick car work waited 1 hr 20 min, last one shop. Saw car saw chart brought frontdesk ago, frontdesk guy didn't give good half hour apparent reason. When I asked what's finally processed car turned put expensive oil shop. Dude, really think I can't see purpose? You couldn't convince buy extras thought you'll sneak I won't notice. Then I noticed, tried bullshit option car. Cheaters go business. I hope do.
If market 6 hour oil change I found place you. So first ever review online. I brought truck flat tire yesterday oil change. I dropped truck 12:36 PM told would take 2-3 hours. So I left truck there. At 4:30PM I returned work thinking must complete since 4 hrs later. At 5:00PM front desk guy asked I also need oil change (which I found shocking considering I brought even started yet.) 5:15PM I ask much longer going take. The front desk clerk said much longer. I respond completed almost 2 hours prior. He stated busy. Then knew busy I dropped truck off. So I told truthful time long would actually take, I could decide I wanted drop not? At 5:30 asked I wanted tire bed truck. I responded I wanted tire put back truck. For reason translated I wanted spare tire truck put chrome tire back truck. At point I'm starting look hidden camera, thinking sort joke. Even I told clerk I pick daughter school 6 seemed move even slower. At one put I could see 3 gathered around cell phone. 6:15 PM truck finally done. Was charged full synthetic oil (even though never asked it). So conclusion: Does value time customers Long drawn service w/ sense urgency Bunch clown. Don't waste time, go place care getting car work completed timely fashion.
I lived townhouse Motheral owns past year half so. Linda (the property manager retired - thank GOD) worst! At first nice us prompt repairs getting back us - towards end lease became extremely difficult work wouldn't stop bothering us even retired. Honestly needs get life stop bothering tenants longer responsibility!! The reason I gave 2 stars new property manager seems incredibly nice I don't want totally deter everyone Linda bad seed. It's sad location one best Shadyside live - God forbid ask reasonableness comes certain issues.
Slow service response. I've lived one apartments motheral inc manage year. They irresponsible repairing facilities. Our ac wasn't working moved in, told us doesn't matter cuz summer it's still repaired now. Linda quite arrogant woman bad attitude. Always come without prior notice leave doors open. Not recommend.
This greasiest pizza I've ever Pittsburgh, I couldn't eat it.
Worst pizza I've Pittsburgh. I ordered last weekend. The pizza (pepperoni) flavor crust way chewy. The Buffalo wings cooked well, tender juicy, almost sauce whatsoever; luckily I wing sauce fridge order save them. Maybe one bad night, I give another chance later, based one experience, I can't recommend place anyone.
Ahh, place near train station open past 9 PM, isn't overpriced and/or full people way jolly early hour. I got slice cheese pizza onion rings. The pizza decent. There nothing flavorful sauce grease would stop oozing cheese. I felt sick I got halfway it. That reminds - slices HUGE, $2. The onion rings extremely basic - I gave couple drunken girls debated eat half hour. One irritating thing I overheard: girl trying place order, cashier kept interrupting say things like "we don't anymore" "no, can't cook wings dry." Sounds like menu staff needs updated.
I pizza Pizza Parma today lunch meeting work. A colleague brought in, I didn't pay can't comment price. I slices pepperoni pizza found resoundingly average. Nothing special, nothing especially good bad. Crust, sauce, cheese, pepperoni, fin. It little greasy, quite cheesy well. I starving I really enjoyed it, I think overall pizza pretty generic. Still, late night slice live nearby need pick quick pizza dinner, I'd say go it. Just don't high expectations.
Pizza Parma many characteristics I like pizza joint. 1) They deliver say will, 2) Diverse menu toppings, 3) Coupons, 4) Online ordering, 5) Take credit cards. I think Pizza Parma shines specialty pizzas. Artichoke, Buffalo Chicken, Spinach & Feta, Greek pies delicious. I've also pasta dishes, I can't complain. It's nice something pizza delivered; portions huge, come bread salad. Pizza Parma fails wings, though. The texture unappealing (aka, flappy chicken skin-- yuk!), sauces lack depth. Desserts also worth buy.
I've known better order salad pizza joint. I also known I shouldn't cheated diet. I figured I'd choose today cheat day order everyone else work take out. I opted Popcorn Chicken Salad. Sounds tasty, looked tasty, yes even tasted tasty. Iceberg lettuce, grape tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions, french fries, popcorn chicken, three types cheese. I say even though I saying yes, body saying, 'OH hell no!' I'm regretting decision I sitting discomfort. Not sure salad made feel way. But I'm liking effect I'm getting right now. Could karma turning around kicking ass eating looked healthy really nothing equivalent fried chicken sandwich combo meal fast food joint. I'll think twice next time rolls around order here.
When boyfriend I flu, ordered food Eat24. I got chicken noodle soup got seafood calzone. When I unpacked food tried sip soup, I found cold bubbles it, soap it. I couldn't really taste anything, boyfriend said smelled like dishwater. To say least, I disappointed soup. When boyfriend cut calzone, said cheese barely melted. We thought undercooked touched outside. It cold, sitting open long time. He tried take bite, dough barely even cooked contents seafood calzone cold tasted sour. This first time ordering sad experience have, since food inedible. I heard place good great calzones tasty soup, received complete opposite praise I've heard place.
I mean person, vindictive person. I bear friendly people Pizza Parma ill will. But pizza remarkably terrible. Went there, hungry, bit past midnight, looking little something going home sleep. They don't slices--this seems (terrible, stupefying, egregious) trend parts. Fine. The smallest pizza, "personal" pie, costs $7 7" diameter. The cashier I agree that's small amount pizza, since I'm hungrier one one half mouthsful, I get "small," 10". I add mushroom topping. I pay $11.21 wait. There two seating options inside store: small wooden bench, two fold chairs around little table. Conveniently, using wooden bench store rolled carpet laid across whole thing, they'd also elected fold two folding chairs, probably tired long day used chairs. So I waited outside store bench. The friendly cashier friendly patrons waiting order indoors called pizza ready. I took outside, sitting cold eat it, thinking, "I hope $11 pizza pretty good." Opened box, saw pitifully small 10" pizza is, started eating. Let say something pizza: decent cheese, decent tomato sauce, flour, water, hot oven, make passable pizza. I eat think, "well isn't best pizza I've ever it's fine." That I thought I ate Pizza Parma's pizza. I thought, "it would rude insulting ask money back. I'll try eat much I can." I ate three six "slices." (One sixth 10" pizza total *25/6 = 13 square inches. That sounds like lot pizza, fact tiny amount pizza.) I couldn't stand eat half. The mushrooms fine; I fished ate them. The cheese actually terrible; strange chemical taste plasticky appearance. The crust poofy crusty. Ashamedly, I threw half pizza away tonight. Folks, I food destroyer. I eat things I don't like, expired foods, I don't want waste. It takes legitimately terrible pizza actually throw thing away. Went home, made eggs, guess what? The terrible cheese taste hour half ago? It's still mouth. I'm making up. I know there's good pizza around here. Ordered two back back slices Spak Brothers--delicious! Tasty! Reasonable price! But whoaaaaaaa whoa terrible, overexpensive pizza. Sheesh.
Terrible pizza. Just plain gross. The crust gummy cheese tasted like plastic. I would never order food again. Gross, gross, gross.
How one could bring eat astounding. The places dirty, food bad, prices high. This cookie cutter pizza low quality, low character, minimal emphasis cleanliness. Never again....
Since I'm bad mood, I figured would turn Yelp write another review pizza Parma!!! You see kids, My last review removed, two star (ha, lose whole star, smarty pants turn inner) I spoke horrible pizza was. How utterly disgusted I it. For sensitivities, I'll less graphic time around, okay kiddo? I spent days toilet eating pizza. My gut mess calling spade spade, pizza overpriced quality lack quality, is. The hoagie better. Even six year old thought horrid kid almost eats anything. I still recommend eating pizza places I feel it's yelping duty save others gross, distrusting dining experience. Plus, took forever us received said pizza, master mind spent quality time, assuring it's rancidness. Whatever. Go ahead turn Yelp police honest bad, awful, terrible pizza!
I love chicken salads yummmm .. And good pizza chilly house order
When I kid mom took 6 us (ten years ago). Because fact I choose place adult. It AWEFUL! My appointment 8:30 am, I time. I sat waiting room 9 am. When I asked I would seen seemed think I already seen! I waited 30 mins lobby. Not cool!
Terrific eye doctors! Their hours odd (they differ eye doctor available), eye doctor got 30 minutes. Ordered contacts eyeglasses quickly efficiently too. The negative would mischarges copays. I'll fix next time I'm in.
The appointment rushed didn't seem take one vision concerns seriously. I wouldn't go back here, especially many options eye doctors area.
I set want give place 3 stars simply another laundry place put bind place open 24 hrs. I thought late hours alone give star. Then I experience --Poor ventilation I could barely breath cramped small dryers washers lining two narrow corridors. ---- misleading advertising boasts "high capacity" washers says air conditioned, well air conditioners vents ceiling dripping black dust look like installed 1963. might I felt instant asthma attack coming on. Then high capacity washers 2.... great enough meet demand turns one girl took I waiting. Then another woman waited wash took two 1030-11:00 pm night I Imagine like try get one hours. Then guy I guess attendant owner, wiping machines dryers. I moving clothes dryer I put bras hangers shirts top washer. I literally loading right area heading back grab things touched them!! Ugh laundry violation ya don't touch someone's wet clothes feels like time college someone would mess dump clothes behind washers didn't move quickly enough. Sooo pissed off...... I get job done I load clothes. I come back check drying clothes.... I find dryer mysteriously switched high heat low heat. Now I forced put another quarter finish load. All I spent 8$ econowash 2 large loads I wasn't able third load washers that. I much Laundry Factory around corner though. So I going there. I don't need creepy dude changing dryer settings touching stuff.
So, unfortunately I've outsource laundry-doing last couple weeks dryer building broken not-so-prudent landlord hasn't helpful repairs (ugh!!). Twice last two weeks, I've washed loads laundry late night discovered dryer hasn't worked. It's really great know place right street open 24/7, especially Laundry Factory street closes 9pm (which general I much prefer place). But convenience-sake, I appreciate place. On cons list, it's incredibly clean I used dryers simply don't work here.
I recently visited Whole Foods first time life, I pleasantly surprised. I particularly shocked prices--not they're worthy "Whole Paycheck" nickname, they're surprisingly low. Perhaps nickname developed people who'd previously shopped cheap-o supermarkets. I like well-stocked salad bar dining area, rest Pittsburgh, apparently. Half city assembling salads last visit. Vegan items clearly marked such, everything fresh.
Whole paycheck fitting name. This Whole Foods decent regular items prepared food prices gotten really high late. I used shop almost everything common products almost grocery store less. Whole Foods it's day unique place shop hard find organic produce products. Now it's expensive.
Hello! I work pretty close Whole Foods I frequent 3-4 times week lunch. If you're M-F 12-1, find salad/bread area (on north end). Compared Whole Foods I've to, I would actually rate 3 considering I know Whole Foods around, I thought it's duty know Whole Foods chance give try. If zucchinis Market District looked little weak, give Whole Foods try. Plus pre-made food actually yummy. I'm able keep lunch budget buying lettuce chicken salad bar (typically 1/2 pound). I stash dressing, cranberries, cheese office. I've tried buying bag pre-washed lettuce I never finish I hate seeing go bad. $3 lunches isn't bad all. Other notes: The tofu chicken really good (part salad bar)! It's always available though. Also, none bread varieties impress me. I like sushi rolls. If I could afford $8/day lunches, I'd probably everyday. I'd give cashiers 5 stars. =)
Great selection vegan, vegetarian, raw milk, prepared foods, bakery, cheeses aged beef. Very expensive, trader Joe's Market district come mind cheaper alternative. Parking particular store nightmare.
My next stop today Whole foods replenish vitamins. I really hate coming here. It's always packed people drive like humongous IDIOTS! I quickly grabbed blood builder, biotin, vitamin C. I tried walk around check hot foods, sushi, anything I might like lunch I felt like I crowded concert hall! People bumping right left! If I stopped ponder one spot someone ass staring down. Sooo mood I hurried got out. While pulling parking spot two drivers wanted spot basically blocked fighting it, one lady started pulling back nearly hit car. Oh NO WAY! I decided usual neighborhood store would fail me, co op I drove...fast! Ha ha looked review. It sounds bad I give props vitamin selection craze!
everything cluster. store. parking lot. people -- customers included. full-on cluster. barely parking massive, heavily polluting pick truck. inside: avocados price gold, goddamn vegan taco spices place that's supposed fancy. meh. go market district keep real. real classy!!!
In general I like Shake N' Steak, location hit miss location! You never know kind quality service you're going find here. A friend went weeks back movie one worst trips EVER! You can't entirely blame waitress since one entire place...poor scheduling manager's part. However, can't accountable slooooow service, accountable orders incorrect. The burgers cooked fries soggie milkshake runny best... By far worst visit Steak n' Shake!
The thing worse food service.
This horrible experience restaurant I years!!!!!!!!!!!! I around 9pm, 9 folks family (visiting relatives included). There several things got annoyed, one another. I ok took us seated. But ordered, really got angry food took VERY long time arrive. We 2 kids us ordered 2 kids meals, asked brought sooner. After 25-30 minutes nothing, I went servers (who NOT paying attention us anyway - main server's name table Angel) asked meals were. One checked another, informed working it. What made even angrier tried downplay everything, telling 5 minutes. Then one servers (manager?) tells "ok, may it's 10 minutes, it's coming". Then I hear servers talking orders. The gentleman came table, sat next told it's 10 minutes working order, tried give explanation that's really long time all. It clearly almost half hour longer time. The food finally arrived 10 minutes that. But food came cold. We HUNGRY point, ate whatever could. Neither Angel anyone else came top drinks even ONCE. I ask mine, point I mood take sip even. I paid ($58.20) I got gentleman tried (again!) explain 10 minutes, "given everything, within normal limits". Wow. After hour half restaurant, shook heads left. I written website, see follow up. We vowed NEVER go restaurant again. Yikes!!
Terrible wait staff couldn't even seat us. Before we, another party walked without even greeted properly, I observed several employees traipse front door, several tables waiting food long time, several employees standing around direct view tables, morbidly obese hostess could barely physically walk one end store other. I think one server high. Going special request 7 year old getting long-ish illness, makes shabby treatment enraging.
I really like chili. Burgers fair salads pretty bad. Pretty hard mess side salad. As others said never know kind service get. Store usually understaffed cleanliness fair. The staff usually disinterested customers sometimes outright rude. All pay get. Cheap crap service.
Food good, you'd expect Steak n Shake. THE SERVICE IS AWFUL. incredibly awful. expect take least hour meal, even it's slow. I've going years I want cheap meal, service awful. Go McDonalds.
The service fast food terrible service. I bus catch I couldn't wait around waiting check I went counter pay. She never brought check, never checked see drink needed refilled, mopped floors. The burger really greasy, fries Luke warm cheese wasn't flavorful be. As new Pittsburgher I'm impressed.
I don't think it's much ask advertise drive thru open 24/7. Then open 24/7. I work late night job. The past three times I tried get food late night I haven't able to. Twice greeted drive thru never got back twenty minutes I drove away. Tonight told drive thru closed. Really? Awful location. Awful service. Went inside try get food, I ignored staff. How hard get burger? Don't go here.
You know you're getting Steak N Shake: it's one rung McD's quality, two rungs quickness. At least, think know. I used small place heart (though salt fat weren't kind said organ) Steak N Shake, hey, argue beef drinkable ice cream? But last trip, I think nothing disgusting eat here, location particular. I haven't back year, I never step foot Steak N Shake long I immune system I care about. After eaten here, I hit restroom way (along two friends....hey, we're girls, it's acceptable!). One stall already taken, two us stuck waiting occupant her....shall say, business? After seconds, realize she's relieve herself, also take drive-through orders. Yes, that's right...."You want fries that? *flush* Okay, $5.50". I never, ever witnessed anything insane drive-through restroom. To top off, finishing "bathroom break", walks straight stall restaurant. I guess much rush complete order taken didn't time wash hands. And I much rush choke back I eaten wreaked mayhem stomach.
I like occasional steak shake stop..... one slowest one ever. The cashier rude I could hear yelling fucking kidding register working way wanted.... wow.... wow...
Every time come service laughably bad. On visit tabe sat us food server graced us surly presence. Good restaurant elsewhere, avoid location want get food inside hour.
Wow. Dirty slow. The floors felt like days burger grease spilled over, took 30 m8n get take order.
This location terrible. The drive-thru workers rude give crap food. I waited 5 minutes able order, even 1 car ahead me. Then lady proceeded ask I would like anything burger, (thinking pictures menu they're supposed look like would never false advertise) I asked "doesn't come fixings like picture?" told comes cheese. So I went tell I wanted burger. Pulled around got order pretty quick, later I open burger meat cheese. The meat badly burned cold. It clear burger fresh. I didn't even attempt eat it, waste place. They definitely need better workers.
Awful every category. The service worst I've ever seen. We waiting seated half empty restaurant 5 minutes manager came seated one couple. Then people waiting went counter took rag started wiping down. We still ignore I told alright didn't need table left. I don't know corporate keeps place open. I've complained numerous times never good. Take extra 20 minutes drive South Hills location. Its pretty much exact opposite Waterfront. The food comes hot properly cooked ignored staff.
Steak 'n Shake's food pretty good prices aren't bad quantity food. I ordered grilled chicken salad dressing. The salad looked thrown together $5.49 2 croutons, tomatoes, carrots, cabbage, lettuce chicken breast. (They forgot cheese!) The staff wasn't friendly helpful seemed like didn't want there. There usually long wait Steak 'n Shake, catch aren't busy, breeze through- drive-thru is. I like food eat healthy options, staff isn't helpful quality isn't always there.
It's okay. Food cheap portions small. For example I order chicken tenders, I got 3 little tiny tenders, decent amount fries. Also restaurant really clean either. This restaurant number 1 choice.
I really don't know place stays open. I've couple times. The service slooooow. They bring food never way ordered it, put Bill table never come back check you. If place packed I could understand it's usually half full. On last visit took us 10 minutes get waitresses attention. We asked mustard, mayo, lettuce, tomatoes burgers. It took 5 minutes get mustard mayo. The lettuce tomato never came. It's safe say won't back. We like food shakes worth put poor service.
The hostess (Jenn Jess, I'm sure) atrocious. I autistic asked moved right beside kitchen noise levels, made huge deal it. I ended crying outside waiting partner let know we'd moved. 15 minutes later, still moved gotten food, partner I left. This 1:45 PM Thursday. Not busy. Just bad service. Our waitress polite, though.
I know service speed isn't chain-wide issue. This place REALLY. SLOW. We ordered 40 minutes ago. Still food.
I ordered online last night suppose done 7:!5pm. I get small line somehow took 30mins. When get counter looks print says done few. I ask speak manager calls manager named Rachel show. At 8:05pm goes check food saying something! It counter whole time. My Food cold nerve say come again. I Think Not!
..such upsetting experience here. My family lives hour away came town dinner Dave & Busters. We knew D&B's food overpriced always long wait decided here. We party 6 adults 1 kid. Raquan server nice. He took order sadly waited 45 minutes com.Everyone around us ordered 15 minutes already food. I've worked steak n shake before. less 10 minutes cook burgers fries. I idea kitchen lost ticket see server talking order atleast top it. The manager needs better training. He stood register entire time cashing people even though clearly kitchen behind customers dining area angry (saw couple leave waiting server another table talk manager wait time). Again i've worked another steak n shake. The counter girl responsible cashing people take orders.. manager helping grill over-seeing everything going on. Poor Raquan keep coming apologize whenever manager have. Who tf trained boss here? Sadly hour restaurant 45 minutes waiting food, told server leave. He told us dont worry drinks. We tipped went eat chikfila. At least rest night fun D&B. shoutout Raquan . You're real MVP
Server took 15 minutes even seat me, 10 even take order. Found didn't even I wanted, common accurance lately. Once I got drink(COLA shot cherry), flat tasted little like cough syrup. Their first attempt meal, grilled cheese steak burger melt(in essence steak burger grilled cheese), I served plain grilled cheese. Once gotten another sandwich, seemed right except awkward stack pickles middle, spread out. It may seem little nitpickey point, far worst experience I've restaurant, first. I don't think I'll returning suffer again.
Waitress kind beginning attitude declined rapidly. Food alright except French onion soup. Couldn't believe waitress thought okay serve. A table nearby problem food. Waitress rude manager never came address issue. Terrible customer service.
This worst place I've maybe ever to. The outside filthy trash over. The inside maybe worse, trash dirty. The employees awful, rude, slow caring thing. I can't even guess unsanitary might be. Disgusting.
Another store gone way Dodo bird. Actually nothing basement like it. What done empty space question?
I've eaten that's enough. The atmosphere cozy, wait staff friendly fast prices reasonable. Unfortunately food wasn't good. I served cooked eggs raw bacon biscuits stale. I don't know inexperinced cook bad luck, bad food bad food.
Moved new neighborhood, get try new pies :D Pasquarelli's Pizza House jumped page place try. Yes, name alone, haha. After told don't deliver do, actual order took place. No, can't get double extra pepperoni(-1 pizza good dictate want it) extra cheese. No, can't get menu Hot Sausage. Too many "no's" me. No, don't Coke Pepsi. No, don't bottles.(-1 "No's") Large Pie Pepperoni Ham 2 cans Mountain Dew $19.18, seemed little expensive compared prices Mt Wash, would $14-$16, mas. (-1) The delivery occurred ahead stated 45 minute time, delivery guy great. The dough little tough, fact jaw hurt 2 slices. I tried another piece half hour later really tasty crust bit softer. I also like "Dirty Crust" (+1), flip crust size covering presauced section, putting small bit sauce inside crust. They sauce crust edges sloppy get cheese top, Dirty Crust. Yummy!
Ooooppss...update time. Got regular (steamed spinach lasagna) hot bar way work. So, I'm dinner break sitting, chatting co worker eating. I see something white spinach putting mouth. WTF that! OMG, looks like one fat ass worms we'd pluck greens grandma's garden. I threw fork co worker says..." you're seeing stuff." Um NOT! I sat digging spinach determined find damn worm. Thirty minutes later SHAZAM...found it. Ugh, coworker spread open spinach leaf. EEEkkkk, bigger fatter black spikes poking out. FUCK! Call manager Co-op says..."Bring refund, thanks nice it...We usually see worms fruits." Geez, thanks lil tidbit. This happened last week around Sept 14, 2010. Guess means it's really organic, huh?
This store quite expensive, I shocked cream costs 13-14$ whereas one costs 11-12$ Whole Foods online store (http://www.vitacost.com/weleda-calendula-diaper-care) around 7$ . The store seems kind ripoff. Also I got food made quite sick - tabbouleh. My diarrhea didn't want stop day - first experience like food called health food store. There options store like instance Whole Foods 8 min away. Whole foods often sales one doesn't. Also strange old/rotten smell going Co-Ops place - indicator something wrong. I think owned 8000 members, enough people spreading word great. But truth - expensive store big attitude, little offer.
Over I like it, going main grocery run. I like organic options, especially produce, beans grains. I hate parking situation, prices significantly higher I expect, even organic.
When I go organic I go reccommend clients! Mark CPT bestpapersonaltrainercom
This store around since 60s. Never disappoints great food people. Shop small businesses never get tired it!
MEAN CUSTOMERS -ALOOF WORKERS+GOOD FOOD = CRAZY! Official Rant Angry Woman: First - I shop "Whole Paycheck" cause household eats organic whether I like WF best organic food prices neck woods. IT'S STILL GOD DAMN RIDICULOUS EXPENSIVE I take family units nutrition health seriously! WORD!! Downhill here... THE CUSTOMERS AND PARKING LOT ARE MORE BAT SHIT CRAZY THAN MENTAL HOSPITALS I'VE WORKED AT! I watched rich bitch elderly women NEARLY murder pedestrians crash cars trying park Lincoln Continentals parking lot I'd ever care witness! Also - I mother young child SHOVED mentioned rich bitches reaching products freezer cases WITH MY CHILD IN MY ARMS! I briefly entertained SHANKING said bitch alas prison orange color wheel! The customers worst human beings earth (::thinks self, shakes head, laughs...except course::). YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE SHADYSIDE HAGS! You treat employees like dogs - like one level dirt. If I worked I would hang cheese section! The customers worst cross section Pittsburghers ever!!! That said- I understand employees like stunned fish - keeping things close vest RICH BITCH SHADYSIDE MONSTERS don't feast flesh fits rage! BUT I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT...one female cashier shall remain nameless SHIT treated like tree killing whore I handed one Internet print coupon single sheet computer paper - ROLLED eyes PAINSTAKINGLY tore coupon paper folded unused paper placed pocket!

If see woman child dressed like Rambo Baby Rambo running WF screaming wielding gallons milk - it's trying survive another trip WHOLE PAYCHECK HELL!
i'm recycling / re-using/sustainability lot items ... junk / ugly crap one real aesthetic taste would want home. probably better sourcing fixtures industrial / commercial spaces ...
If you've got talent create something unexpected, HAVE stop here. I looking something unusual use apartment storage. I stopped several big box stores around city left one disappointment. I must admit, driving place I little skeptical. I pulled honestly thought Yelp directed warehouse. But I let deter venturing car building. Once walk inside like walking someone's garage want rummage through. You know I mean, walk see dingy looking stuff see potential in. You want take home you. sometimes want polish make look new, times want let let distressed look shine through. I easily spent hour browsing shelves. I saw potential lot items I saw lining shelves. And I took items home me. When I reached register I truly floored price. When I say that, it's low. I expecting pay more, I definitely came money pocket I needed to, one sure fired way make sure person returns establishment.

If you're old houses, reserve least 30 minutes get whole store won't disappointed.
parking lot @ wholefoods ABOMINATION! compound issue, whole foods allows purveyors park centre ave (a road already miserable enough drive on) block traffic. past monday, shearer potato chip truck blocking right lane. doesn't whole foods loading dock? wrote email district president one store minions respond: "you park @ walgreens". sorry, shopping @ wholefoods NOT walgreens. translation: whole foods developers TOO CHEAP buy proper amount real estate. dont even bother coming fri-sun unless like clusterF*** lot full zombies. 5th WF shopped @ (4 florida) wholefoods opened south hills. demographics would support it. wholefoods BUSH LEAGUE!
As DIY'er - place sanctuary. I've quite times weekends .. buy .. browse around. This place huge pretty much find anything. If can't find something you're looking - simply ask one CJ personnel making rounds make sure you've found you're looking for. I looking bi fold door weeks ago found exactly I looking less $15. - find doors low $5 I'm talking dirty stained broken door. Besides used goods - new "recycled" items including plastic corrugated roof panels paints super low prices. Also, you're remodeling house need throw old materials - number recycle bin simply drop off.
I tried Whole Foods recently even hearing attitude butthole, hipster employees presumptuous, bourgeois customers literally push aside turn noses million times. The rumors true!!! Even though I one time, first impressions bitch! The selection great! I can't afford it, it's great! I never seen expensive rice! Here bro-down... The food: Plentiful expensive even think buying. The freshest fish isn't Strip...but need take second mortgage buy fish family. I bought sushi rice, piece fish salad, bill: $25! The salad lettuce, carrots, chick peas, onions 5 pieces chicken $11+ The employees: Hipsters thick-rimmed glasses, tattoos facial piercings slack like I never seen "workers" slack before. In fact sign fresh fish stating "We prepare fish way want, ask" HA...HA! When I asked tiny fish filleted (something would take 10 seconds home) I scoffed called fish monger obviously trained fish monger, got job Progressive music soviet era bachelors degree . It took better part 20 minutes fillet f-ing fish! All I got chopped piece crap useless. And scoffing people good at. Pushing cart aisles like running scoffing gauntlet. Staff huff puff get way?! The cashiers stand talk run get organic iced tea drink WHILE ring up...they don't even Giant Eagle! The customers: This one peach! If you're pulling good $60K year dirt people. I salad bar (it good salad bar, expensive) older woman mink coat bumped, no, pushed stared turned nose me, believe it? She actually turned nose me! Others aisles grunt like cantankerous old people can't get through. They push ahead line, give dirty looks, act like it's class struggle...it kind is! So unless lot (i mean A LOT) disposable income, never needed use coupons, drive $50K car (parking terrible there), president United States, CEO Microsoft, widow whose wardrobe extensive explanation formula explaining event horizon hipster looks poor, lives daddy mommy (though they'll never admit it) shouldn't really won't able afford place...but would want to? I'll stick Trader Joe's alternative market, thank you! I prefer employees edges little rough ones pants tight, I see junk.
Forget Giant Eagle, Giggle, Market Crap etc. Whole foods gets bad rap "expensive" yes I agree ridiculously expensive things there, IGNORE get basic essentials. They always running specials, get good deals. If actually try price compare GE whole foods, you'll find whole foods actually cheaper, reason don't shop people feed thinking you'll spend "whole paycheck" there. What crap. Write list, prioritize buy things sale. Whole foods much better selection (freshness wise) produce, meats, cheese across board. Yes find great stuff strip, also find reasonable items here. Over summer I went scavenger hunt clams, Wholeys/GE gross overpriced! Whole foods fresh clams much cheaper two locations! Try out, won't sorry.
I hate going dentist. I dread it, it's awful. It's really important vital long term well being, however, I best suck up. Harvey best dentist I to. He's holistic practitioner. He's done deep cleaning (worst thing I could ever imagine), removed replaced lead ("silver") fillings. This important vacuums trace amounts would ingested part. He introduced terrific mouth wash really made difference health gums. You tell really cares health I really appreciate thorough conscientious is.
I think Whole Foods Giant Eagle Market District competing title annoying place shop. It starts parking experience, ridiculously horrible location - poorly planned. And then, there's prices - Giant Eagle quite expensive compared similar grocers cities, Whole Foods obviously get one those; it's inherent scheme selling premium "natural" goods. Whole Foods better lighting layout GE, yes, discriminative selection products, especially people specialized diets, like vegans (me) gluten free adherents. The house baked bread might worse GE (tough contest) - often baked thus soggy middle crusts tend fall off; making gluten free-dom seem appealing. And I don't even need talk customer demographics, you've seen Rachel C.'s link!
This store pretty good. Yes fairly expensive get quite items difficult impossible find stores. They nice meat department quite good naturally raised products, particularly beef. We've happy produce, find noticeably better Trader Joe. I wish bigger larger selection larger prepared food selection (we used larger stores Chicago). Also wish liquor department I'll probably run state office that. Frankly worst part often parking. Don't know causes everyone behave badly lot (myself included) man mess. Anyway we'll keep going least meats produce.
The blonde woman tuns gym extremely rude us. First time went refused yo.get phone personal call help us. Then gave us rules bouldering area rapid bored monotone. Compared climbing gyms I gone gym less safe (no gri-gris), unfriendly, expensive. Definitely worth it. Worst customer service I've seen while.
It's bit silly review TCW, basically game town rock climbing. That said, I've climbing least twice week last months. It's large, walls aren't high-tech places I've climbed, setters make good use what's available. Both bouldering top-roping routes seem re-set right rate -- always new-ish routes, turnover isn't fast one can't work problems successive visits. I would love see walls refreshed cement faux-rock style, flowing curves less strict geometry. (Also, plywood slippery! Makes hard smear.)
Every while, I'm feeling particularly flush, I battle evil WF parking lot. I tell totally worth order class high quality goodies. The fish meat selection park comes freshness. However, I've purchased flowers twice time dead day three. Both times I allowed molten flowers remain counter extra day serve reminder I'm WF material.
I found bone package in-store made turkey burgers (the tequila lime ones matters). Not cool.
I found caterpillar romaine bag. Eww climbed arm. Goosebumps :( BUT least proof "organic" besides bug green!!!! So healthy !
When I travel work, I often stop Whole Foods pick prepared meals. I know I get good lunch dinner, price comparable upscale fast food options. A weeks ago I really sick came pick cold remedy, lunch, orange juice. This Whole Foods quite national standard. First, Whole Foods fairly small, parking situation disaster. There adequate parking, kind people shop particular Whole Foods worst people ever. People try run parking lot get last spot. It's actually pathetic. The store set-up bit odd, employees aren't particularly friendly here. I felt like I begging someone find Sambucus, isn't fun don't feel well. However, cashiers par. The biggest kick face prepared foods section. At 11:00 AM Thursday prepared food set up. No soup, entrees. Just leftover Oatmeal hardened breakfast name tags prepared food would eventually come out. There two small serving stations well, lot favorite options missing, like mac cheese. If looking standard grocery shopping here, Whole Foods fine. The grocery selections pretty standard, aisles wide enough. This Whole Foods big step gross Market District street, standard pretty low well.
horrible thanksgiving dinner, dry turkey, lumpy pototoes, freaky string beans, real live learn never again, wrote store comment, response, expensive waste, that's exactly
I recently seen Whole Foods first time entire life, I pleasantly surprised. I especially shocked costs--not since worthy "Whole Paycheck" nickname, incredibly low. Probably nickname created people formerly shopped affordable-o supermarkets. I enjoy well-stocked salad bar dining area, rest Pittsburgh, seemingly. Half city gathering salads last visit. Vegan items plainly marked such, everything fresh.
I've taken car Larry, aka Aamco, first time brakes squeaking months. Asked Larry change brake pads said. "No." He said still 80% wear left them. He said bring back year need changing explaining squeaking due lower quality material aftermarket pad guy San Diego installed. Stand guy. Stand service. Now it's year, I'm taking car actually get worked confidence.
If I could give zero stars, I would. Awful! My car wouldn't start I called tow managed get started, it's acting I brought anyways. After car entire week calling once, I've called twice, man phone told ready pick up, nothing wrong it. When I went pick up, I turned I could even leave lot, died! I went back told tow truck operator hooked jumper box pumped gas start it. That's did. Then told probably didn't start sitting long. Then told "I don't know anything car"! I left sure enough trouble getting started next destination, pump gas pedal. Yeah, sounds like "nothing's wrong". DO NOT BRING YOUR CAR HERE. THEY ADMITTEDLY KNOW NOTHING ABOUT CARS!
So, I take SUV Sunday effort know running roughly. I spoke Brian desk polite professional. Sunday went Monday went by. Tuesday morning I get call Brian stated couldn't fix car due able remove bolt without possibly getting heads. What!? Are freaking kidding me!? A NATIONALLY KNOWN GARAGE IS AFRAID TO REMOVE A BOLT!!?? Then I pay $102.67 get SUV back. I HAD TO PAY THEM TO WASTE MY TIME AND DO NOTHING!! I know say never say never, I'm going go limb say never. NEVER WILL I TAKE MY CAR HERE AGAIN. I disappointed AAMCO.
BEWARE - I rented Franklin West I getting Master's Carnegie Mellon. They use CMU students ATM machines everything humanly possible stick move especially leaving Pittsburgh. My list complaints: 1) charged three months rent I moved out, apartment vacant. This lease. They conveniently forgot mention I gave advance notice going vacate apartment. 2) return $1500 security deposit. 3) three years I move out, send delinquent account credit agency (they still owe security deposit), messing credit rating. They never reached me, once!
I called office get lightbulb replaced, one maintenance staff took pictures inside apartment without knowledge permission. Apparently dog crate I home Franklin Wests' standards, sent letter including pictures taken without knowledge. After receiving threatening letter "reminding me" lease I regretfully signed, fiancé called ask taking pictures inside apartment without knowledge. They said enter apartment time like, apparently means photograph things well. If pets, don't even bother renting properties. Pet deposit/rent ridiculous. I get harassed dog needs crated I'm gone. Oh even suggested I put baby doggy day care, **** I supposed afford I'm paying security deposit, pet deposit, rent, pet rent? I've basically told I'm getting security deposit back. Their reasoning dog crated SAFETY maintenance guys. My dog 10 lb papillon. One pictures sent decided photo shoot inside apartment dog laying bed. Very vicious indeed. I'm scared even home now. That's life I'm comfortable with. Especially dog registered emotional companion dog doctor vet sent letters Franklin West stating that, yet still considered threat. Six months left lease... Wish luck guys. Ps- If go leasing office see one employees' dog roaming around, mine locked crate. DO THEY NOT SEE THE HYPOCRISY?
Basically group lawyers understand use archaic Pittsburgh laws screw students. Ridiculous policies move fees. Their auto renewing leases set traps
I really wish I would looked reviews choosing rent Franklin west. Please take negative reviews seriously valid. They really try impress looking properties nice properties. As soon you're lease courtesy ends. They everything charge extra fees. The management horrible never understanding. I know process apartment hunting please look elsewhere.
Jimmy Tsang's Chinese Restaurant one old "traditional" Pittsburgh restaurants, place remember always "being there." My parents feel way it. It good, unspectacular place reliable, tasty fare like honey chicken, Chinese flank steak, authentic eggrolls. I don't normally go spicy fare, indeed I prefer plainer dishes like chicken vegetables, one item menu I've always wanted try--Sau La Gi, stir-fried hot spicy chicken, onions, green onions & fresh bean sprouts. Perhaps I've never noticed, I don't recall seeing anywhere else. It good, Hoo-Boy I pace eating it. And plenty water nearby! Sau La Gi worth trying once, really wasn't tastes I doubt I'll again. My friend Maryann tried Ching Za Gai (spicy also) roasted crispy chicken served tangy vinaigrette sauce. I sampled perhaps I order next time. I'd like cook milder version home. More tastes however Garden Chicken, Chicken Broccoli, Beef Pea Pods. Seafood dishes include Sweet Sour Shrimp Sauteed Shrimp Szechaun Style. Yeah, I'm little unimaginative comes Chinese food, I know I like place basics right, it's okay book! Jimmy Tsang's also convenient inexpensive lunch menu. The place also Korean Barbecue book private dining room special someone $100 deposit.
Walking Jimmy Tsang's like walking Chinese restaurant Hawaii Five-0 - puts back time 1960's food reminiscent era also. Hot & Sour soup highly americanized, hot sour. Wonton Soup large portion good. Egg Rolls large, slightly greasy filling flavorless, good. Cheese wonton's okay old grease used fry over-powered flavor. Chinese Flank steak tough chewy soy style sauce thickened cornstarch, little salty greasy overall good. Flaming chicken chicken breast sugar peas, bamboo shoots baby corn white/clear cornstarch chicken base sauce, lacked much flavor except slat - okay. Tea tasted like American Lipton brewed large quantities back served generic tea-pot. The place clean service good, prices good, food average.
I really feel bad giving one-star review. First, it's service, price, decor, food. I'm writing review going twice. The first time husband I went, dinner good. We thought place potential go-to Chinese restaurant Pgh. Today I remembered early-bird special 3-6pm (m-sat). The ton soup authentic (more like chicken noodle soup) wasn't bad. The entree fine. What really knocked score 1 awful tobacco/cigarette smell tea!! ? !! I go grocery store buy pack gum. The smell wouldn't leave I came home rinse mouth Listerine (2-3 minutes) brush (as long I could) get rid smell. Did use tea pot ash tray? [first visit: 3 stars] + [second visit: -5 stars] = [ -2 stars]
Closed. Signage down. Boarded tight. Phone disconnected.
Yep, closed! My dad I gonna come dinner last night. He called told meet China Palace instead. So long Jummy Tsang's! You one last old time Chinese joints.
This cut paste review I wrote apartmentratings. I read poor reviews Kamin, decided reserve judgement places I saw myself. I must say experience today, I'm thinking reviews far hyperbolic. I scheduled see two units today - one Walnut one S. Negley. When boyfriend I arrived first place, building manager, Paul informed us could look unit Walnut Street because, "They identical apartments...Same builder everything, want fight traffic time day, can." First Paul, floor plan may same, two units alike. The kitchen may updated one maybe bathroom tile different, building may smell different maybe potential tenant wants see view window. Secondly, we're going potentially sign lease pay almost $1,400 per month, we'd least like see actual unit we'd living in. In addition that, apartment three blocks building. We felt 8 minute walk would terrible inconvenience (for us anyway, Paul seemed hurry.) Anyway, got first place Paul let us in. Rather engage us talk us apartment, stood living room arms crossed left us wander apartment own. He didn't offer information answered questions one two word answers. Seriously, he's rude now, what's going like lease gets signed? Strike one. After left building Walnut, boyfriend I walked S. Negley met Paul there. He let us led us upstairs actually let door slam right face. What nice guy! And gentlemanly! Strike Two. When got second apartment, wandering around I noticed gigantic water mark bubbling paint corner ceiling one bedrooms lovely black stain I assume mold. The current tenant informed roof leaked. Noooooow I know Paul didn't want us looking second unit! Strike three. Kamin's out. We turned around walked point. I say though Paul us favor incredibly rude, unprofessional overall kind tool. Heck maybe hates working Kamin way "sticking man." If weren't him, may believed whatever BS story *good* salesman would given us they're fixing roof whatnot may actually bought story miserable year. How lucky us Kamin "pleasant" guy dealing public. It's sad though overall apartments would desirable weren't Paul obviously leaking roof. On greener pastures!

Kamin Realty showed profound lack professionalism. Would take several days respond e-mails, chose respond all. I make several phone calls ever get response Kamin representative helpful gracious work with. Put deposit place, however 3 days later, due unforeseen circumstances I cancel. Instead working refunding possibly working re-advertising cost Kamin denied services left $700 dollars. In end, I glad things didn't work since seemed like would horrible landlords.
I haven't even moved apartment yet I'm already regretting renting property Kamin. Paul showed us apartment nice. I would give 5 start rating. It's woman answers phones emails I find extremely rude off-putting. So far, hung phone, raised voice multiple times, told "get calendar" I asked get back apartment week Memorial Day. I sent email questions Paul I didn't want deal anymore. Paul never saw email instead answered long email questions one word sentence. If I could back lease point, I totally 100% would, solely receptionist. But unfortunately I trapped. Their apartments decent, receptionist needs attend sessions customer service training general etiquette courses.
I really wanted like Casbah checking menu online. I really wanted like Casbah I saw super cool dark interior restaurant. Unfortunately, everything started go hill there.... The waiter less helpful suggesting wine accompany dinner, I found bit odd nice restaurant. My friend I order split tuna tartare fennel salad start. The tartare decent lacked seasoning I wasn't creme fraiche top. The salad ok nothing rave about. I short rib ravioli reading reviews Yelp, I didn't like sauce accompanied it. My friend ordered risotto oyster mushrooms also less enthused. Don't get wrong, nothing meal terrible, nothing meal spectacular either. It looks like maybe I tried brunch. We shall see I'm willing give Casbah another chance....
Had lack-luster Mother's Day brunch Casbah yesterday. Despite late reservation time 2:30 p.m., seated dungeon-like basement dining room. I asked tables upstairs daylight allegedly way accommodate request. Worst part basement thumping sub-woofer located -- really ridiculous. Service fine. Timing drinks first brunch course acceptable given busy day, gap 35+ minutes entrees left us sitting there, enjoying dark basement nore perpetually thumping base. An utterly forgettable mother's day brunch (luckily took stride) I think Casbah top list book quite awhile.
Lame. Lame heck. The premise seemed kind fun, I got take long Sing Sing disappoint. The $7 cover way high place, drinks good. The music guys played stuff like 1987. Nothing modern, mostly stuff would hear Bob FM two o'clock hour work. The medley Grease crowd pleaser I guess. Part schtick member party birthday wedding pay person dragged stage sing song them. They dirty versions well known songs, really one joke. "Hey Delilah" became "Hey There V****a" cleverest one. Hope like 7th grade dirty jokes, you'll hearing lot them. Mostly ones already know 7th grade. I would recommend anybody go. I want brain cells back.
This place gone significantly hill. I've gone Sing Sing year last 6 7 years. When started going couldn't get seat unless got early. It always packed. However, year crowd seems get smaller smaller. Crowd important component piano bar due interactive nature all. I last Saturday night (8/4/12) 20-30 people there. Very slow boring. It appears crowd longer allowed stage, taking lot interactive fun place used be. This likely last time Sing Sing. Save $7 skip place. A real shame place lot fun.
Always good time, although it's definitely place I would visit often. It's great groups....which quite obvious since always several folks bachelorette parties birthdays. Shut piano players, play piano, also sing, play drums sax. They funny know keep crowd entertained. Also know pretty obscure songs. My big criticism set up. If don't reservation and/or come later evening, it's difficult get seats. Believe me, I don't mind standing, become bit awkward keep scooting let waitresses patrons past you. If find seat, often littered someone else's empty glasses.
The musicians place work hard entertain crowd, I can't say bad. However minimum song request $5. I spent $20 song girlfriend NEVER played it!! They playing songs $5 $10, $40 got where. Even didn't know song, I doubt, could picked one knew improvised, tip, save $$ requests. Otherwise it's fun special events every awhile.
Pretty fun place go every while, but, believe me, end night you'll ready go. The show lasts around 5 hours, 3 hour mark you'll sick sitting crowd $9 pop drinks listening dirty jokes again.
Service terrible time walked in, overcrowded, overrated, live hype least bit.
I didn't like customer service body shop.. There price estimate repair outrageous.. They won't getting business
Typical, new. You see people walking and, I must say, customers look like work living hear. I swear one guys covered head toe soot. That amazing. Ran around store looking items I needed satisfy need build create. Minimal help small quantities employees, actually asked I needed help -- I found item.
When making Customer's paymento atLowe's, checklist: 1. Do phone numbers match? Nope, that's fine since people always changing phone numbers anyways. 2. Does name account match name check? Nope, mistakes happen pesky check companies. 3. Does account number check match account number screen? Why it, computers always making mistakes. Now verified information correct, process payment. The customer happy didn't bother silly questions. ****** I sad say actual occurrence. What originally average Lowe's turned Lowe's Hell. If associates basic logic comprehension, survive?
For record, I returned times still entirely stand original review nearly 3 years ago. I add food portions also seem decreasing! We went happy hour last week I worst tasting rye drink possible - described rye fig jam, bitters lemon, sounded like something cannot possibly fucked up, tasted like nothing juice wrenched unripe lemons - super dry gave stomach ache. No fig flavor detected. To make matters worse, partner tried ask bartender drink, supposed sooo god-aweful lemony, responded "yes, it's got lemon it." When pressed issue, simply repeated, "yes, it's lemon fig drink." More frustrating conversations wall. The risotto ordered size one would expect side dish (which risotto be, proposed entree...). It 5 little pieces maitake mushroom 6 hazelnuts otherwise flavorless. We added lots salt pepper. Total waste $25 bucks. Also, bar seating sucks. The chairs stationary far away other, bit far bar shorty like me; feet don't reach foot bar chair either, legs fall asleep trying sit there.
Waterfront Lowe's beats Monroeville Lowe's lawn garden. Hate admit it, it's true.
My husband I went store June 29th. We planned purchase two doors. We decided pay $35.00 installer come house measure Lowes install doors. We would paying several hundred dollars get doors installed. After installation, Lowe's would refund us the$ 35.00. Our paperwork said would receive call installer within 2 business days. I also questions salesman said dept Manager would call next day. Never received call anyone Lowe's! By July 2 still heard installer dept Manager. I called dept manager asked questions I had. He answered one question said would another millwork person call me. Millwork never called me! By July 3, I called salesman (David Crane). He surprised I heard installer. He told would send message installation dept calling us.Today it's July 8th STILL heard peep anyone Lowes. Our total order planned spending Lowe's around $1700.00 !! I called today asked talk store Manager. I told heard anyone Lowe's going proceed order. I told would like $35.00 back. He said OK, bring receipt next time store. He never apologized, never even asked customer number could look order maybe somehow save sale !!!! I cannot believe unprofessional store ! Goodbye Lowes...Hello Home Depot !! What shame ! David Crane salesperson nice helpful us...too bad losing sale.
I went Lowes items--one dehumidifier. I asked 2 different employees assist--they rude told read box. Being 8 months pregnant I couldn't lift box cart didn't much care. Finally asking another 3 employees--I found one help. So much rudeness --checking trying find items. Clearly zero expectations customer service here.
I can't believe high reviews. Either work Big Burrito it's amateur hour. The food tasted terrible. It bland over-salted reminded Olive Garden. If like Casbah power never again.
Not good vegan experience. We meeting friends Casbah dinner -their choice. Since I follow version vegan, I called ahead assured vegan versions couple pasta dishes. Server cooperative said would instruct kitchen omit meat increase veggies cavatelli. Well, omitted meat, I left one smallest servings pasta I ever seen. At $20, close price caviar!
This place overrated. A friend I looking forward beer good bar food- instead wings terrible beer good overpriced. There's nothing wrong place I don't understand clout around it. There clout.
Before today I probably would given place three stars based mostly beer selection; however, today service terrible. We waited two hours pizza sub, French onion soup, fries, buffalo chicken tenders. About hour half finally got small pizza sub wrongly made buffalo chicken tenders (ie, hot sauce). We told waitress realized wrong, decided still bring see gf would eat it. She sent back. By half hour later, still received buffalo chicken tenders, French onion soup (which mostly made already), fries. We told chef new, effort made really make situation better. No quick easy app beers house. To boot, beer pretty expensive. I probably give place another chance based beer selection, won't while. The food always average best, pizza sub different. We ended leaving two hours without receiving 75% order.
I tried eat 3 times last 2 years...Every time try it's closed? Like today, random March Friday 3 pm. It closed? Do take lot vacations? I've heard good things though.
Lovely, relaxing atmosphere. The cauliflower soup tarragon emulsion fabulous, tomato basil soup. The waiter attentive happily allowed substitution salad I could try one raw milk cheeses cheese sampler. The grilled chicken breast salad bit dry hard I like, I big fan barbecuing chicken certainly seemed charred way. If chicken moist, place would get five stars me!
Shredded Chicken General Tsos... bland!!!! Menu basic. The prices little average certainly worth it. Tasteless. Very disappointed.. never One star nice.
Had corned beef sandwich. Meh. Onion rings horrible. Extremely breaded doughy. Greasy get out. I hope chef take hint breading comes back, I peel away get onion.
ewwww
It wasn't busy night neighborhood, could fooled long food took. While take everyone extremely friendly. The food come hot, least mine did, rest plates plate-warmer hot. Everyone table resented "holding back" table since staff pointed waiting burger. Which hey works segway onto burger. Quesadilla Burger. I knew mistake I anyways. The patty sorta flavorful. The toppings bland category. Cheese went MIA. And tortilla over-toasted tasteless. A big blah overall, sad, since we've grand ole time good food past visits.
The 7 ounce house sirloin bomb! 'Nuff said.
Applebee's chain restaurant found around country. The service friendly added table machine play games, answer trivia questions, add order. There slight fee two former items would swipe card order use it. I normally come week lunch specials. You get choice soup, half sandwich half salad ones listed. I normally order French onion soup along Chinese chicken salad. Although comes fried request grilled get small breadstick go it. It smaller portion regular size items since I don't eat whole lot I find enough. Food okay. Prices reasonable. They another option come times 2 party sharing meal listed menu. On particular visit I noticed young boy celebrating birthday group waiters came gave small dessert sang him. Desserts also reasonably priced overly big. I stop I want change pace want save dollars lunch.
four cheese mac chees honey pepper chicken bomb!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
D&B nice food insanely unhealthy. They also really clever designing psychological context ways extract money customers. You feel bit milked afterwards. Also much fatter. You pay games using credits mag-stripe cards. This lets D&B give games arbitrary prices makes harder really know much spending. Menus drinks food prices. $6.05 Banana Split cocktail? $3.40 Michelob? I idea whether expensive showing prices clever price things obey pricing psychology (like anchors forth). Waitstaff hassle repeatedly order desserts. Oh, dining room plastic demos dessert trays get thought going mind walk table. The games violent shooters racing games don't appear changed much since 2002 I last went D&B California. Hope find innovative arcade games future. Not pleasant experience, least it's different going ordinary restaurant.
Giant Eagle one Pittsburgh's expensive grocery chains. I shop convenient I live. Often times I'm shopping produce I find fruit overripe sometimes find mold them. The one I shop small Market District area easy get around. They rewards program called Advantage card every $50.00 spent get $.10 purchase gas station called Getgo You accrue rewards expire 2 months non use. They floral section one places I find graveside flower arrangements memorials. Still expect pay shop here. Selection particular location average.
I used like giant eagle decided monopolize Kennedy Twp cutting deal local shop n save close doors forced many people one store. They frequently run things this. The place crowded never enough people working support busy holidays. Soon bad going Walmart I shop location fuel perks.
I went brothers bachelor party one dancers pick pocketed brother ! We told security guards dancer threw us club. We buying dances, drinks & party, watch pockets don't get drunk. Management doesn't care! Visit another club, one isn't it!!! Not full bar, pay $20 admission $1 "cup" ...all drink. No food available That say right there.....
Dave Buster's enigma, dining, bar, playground video game lovers? Let get bar part way first, it's overpriced, try get buy glass jack bill. Next, food. Just like chain places Waterfront, sandwiches, burgers (yes blue cheese burger, doesn't?) pasta, salads, chicken fingers, yadda yadda. The games, I swear three quarters games since 2000 place opened. I guess ten years new games hit scene. Overall Dave buster's unique Waterfront, it's time update menu, update games, get second decade 21st century.
Because I significantly younger sisters, I go Dave Busters twice year. It's fun nostalgic me. It get expensive 'prizes' cheap make great "sister days" As food, we've eaten never again. It's blah... frozen fried. The veggie burger put afterthought could say offer it. A frozen Boca patty thrown bun. Thanks! I could ran Costco that. Drinks rather expensive that's expected. So go games, fun laughter maybe stop somewhere else drinks bite eat (skip bountiful chains span Waterfront try Blue Dust Amity Street).
The food absolutely gross! I ordered turkey club comes wheat bun avocado, bacon, turkey breast. What I got TOTALLY different picture! First sandwich sliced bread (lame)! There avocado, 1 slice bacon, lettuce, TOP instead turkey breast used freaking LUNCH MEAT! lol No, kind get deli, sweaty nasty looking stuff! Gross! Our waitress awful extremely understaffed I would bit attitude I wait 10 tables without assistance too. The manager really nice... Of course disgusting sandwich I didn't eat free.
The usual fun center. You play games using play card purchase there. Game prices confusing- - - 2.3, 5.7, 9.9 credits, etc. The arcade fun bring friends. Almost every game ticket game innovative exciting game choices. I didn't eat there, I can't rate restaurant part Dave Busters.
The food alright. Not good. Not bad. And considering portion, prices weren't bad either. The service, hand, terrible. Severely understaffed. Three hours order check. Worst chef put cooked lobster tail back raw shell serve it. Avoid costs.
I ordered fiance small, fall arrangement. It supposed full gerber daisies, one costing around $3. Therefore, I told 7 gerber daisies, along berries filler flowers, total would come around $23. The arrangement showed TWO gerber daisies, pathetic looking fillers, charged $35. I won't call again.
The order process went well delivery arrived timely manner. I saw picture flowers friend received arrangement wasn't even close pictured website...a lot filler flowers despite ordering premium arrangement. I picked place specifically offered despite cheaper places area. I disappointed I wanted best arrangement possible friend going tough time. I order place again.
Not really sure add. So I'll bullet point experience. - Expensive poorly made drinks - Friendly slow service - Ok food considering (Had Philly Steak Cheese) - Over run kids 10 seem zero adult supervision - 15% games order (Air Hockey, Big Bball Game, 1/2 skee ball, random arcade machines) - Expensive games - Fun time overall wife.
Mediocre service. COLD food! Our food waited long lettuce & pickles wilted. Bland food. Crazy overpriced. Long waits arcade. 1 beer per hour maximum. Avoid costs. Fair manager.
Not area, I traveled hour come Uniontown, PA. I excited! I haven't Dave Buster's since I younger ready go back play games! I went cousins, mind you, hadn't ate day hungry. So, decided Eat & Play Combo, naturally. Here's gets bad. First all, get snobby hostess shows us table. Then, wait...and wait...and finally 25 mins get waitress. Her name Ashley. We plenty time decide wanted, quickly put order in. Next, sitting talking, waiting, empty glasses waitress never even come around see needed refills except one time. She said she'd come back right away refills...yea, right. 20 mins later get refills. Mind you, food still hasn't came yet. I see people getting food come us. I frustrated. After waiting 45 mins food, I asked speak manager. One servers I asked replied rudely "Well, he's really busy right now. I doubt he'll able come talk you". Finally, 15 mins later...that's one hour, folks. We get food. What think next problem was? Yep, food cold. I completely fed point, told waitress disappointed I was, especially driving one hour terrible service. The manager never came speak me, didn't even receive meals free. The compensation got $10 game cards. Woopty-doo. The thing good place games, prizes get tickets junk worthless. So, conclusion...I DO NOT RECOMMEND THE WATERFRONT DAVE AND BUSTERS OF HOMESTEAD, PA. It horrible, I returning long time!
This place plain sucks Bad management lost biz Dumb arcade drama* * recently changed 21 policy one underage even arcade restaurant 10pm despite guardian 30 years old
First time Dave & Buster's although I didn't go games, I slightly disappointed. I went group girls dinner drinks. The service slow food decent. The portions huge priced slightly higher average chain. We went 9 pm ton kids Friday night. I suggest want avoid children go 9.
A fun place lots bit pricy. $20.00 buy hundred points last little hour.I recommend bowling game ,ball racing car game connect 4 also several games played groups 4
Visited Dave Busters Homestead, PA last night. Waitress mixed credit cards gave brothers credit card someone else theirs. Charged already - incorrectly My brother walk around find was. Waitress never apologized. GM extremely rude refused give brother original receipt back saying thrown out. DID NOTHING TO REMEDY situation ignored us rest visit - even refill. After spending $300 plus games, never go back. Whatever happened customer always right? HORRIBLE service
My boyfriend I 20s, visited D&B multiple times. After visit yesterday, however, I don't think we'll back. When arrived greeted long line people waiting buy game cards. At first 2 extremely slow workers trying this, one left line still door! The girl left incompetent, taking extremely long fill game cards. We stood line 20 minutes told another attendant actual game room. Needless say, line game room long, still one girl booth. It Saturday! After finally got cards wait yet get beer. 2 bartenders staff bar completely full. It took us almost hour actually could start gaming. The floors filthy trash, bathrooms: repulsive! I use restrooms twice visit, bathrooms I used toilet paper them, TP floors, sinks less cleanly. My boyfriend mentioned guys restroom better, smelled like pee paper towel dispenser didn't work. All I say get crap together. We could see difference type crowed Saturday compared used be, I'm I doubt it's due poor service attention cleanliness. For expensive need staff better weekends. It's shame quickly place gone hill NOT returning anytime soon!
Most games order I find one referee looking people fix 2 took credits. Apathetic service staff around, Peanut I really disappointed. Won't back.
Get white pizza bacon. You're life never same. Never bad experience ordering R&B's.
The food pretty good disappointing service terrible. About 50% times ordered somehow managed screw food.. tonight screwed 2 4 items ordered! I dont know person taking orders hearing problems careless either way irritating getting food I didnt order.. even still good food...
This favorite years. Quality ingredients decent prices. Portion sizes average well. I love Greek pizza, haven't ever disappointed anything I've ordered.
My wife I went around 10pm Saturday night. The food spectacular, quality you'd get Applebee's place similar -- good great. My steak tough, wife enjoyed hers. Staff relatively unorganized (we ate table next bar), wait awhile server. Food prompt.
I 10/3 I say horrible experience. Me friend went eat play couple games afterwards. It took waitress least 10-15 minutes greet us time knew order might see again. We ordered got drinks well let's say didn't see waitress giving us check (some manager delivered food table). No refill beverage, food, ketchup burger fries offered. Lots people running around like crazy understaffed hire people! I back eat.
Awful awful. Spent 150.00SERVICE WAS TERRIBLE. Took 27 minutes even acknowledged. Really. The saving grace kids fun hostess took AMAZING care us......
4 Stars fun factory, games, around experience, 2 stars disgusting food horrible service! I SO excited come boyfriends birthday. Its always fun play games, win tickets, fun friends/family. We decided eat played. I keep seeing commercials new menu, hey couldn't bad right? Wrong! Only thing really good Corona-rita - that's hard mess up. First off, service horrible. I didn't feel like areas packed make service slow, apparently I wrong. It took 15 minutes, minimum, get first drinks. At least hour food. I boneless buffalo wings, hard screw up, mine weren't bad weren't best. My boyfriend Philly Cheesesteak couldn't finish it. Was SO salty good. For price everything, worth all. Better going somewhere else Waterfront food coming play. You'll save $$, time, frustration! I guess also remodeling price area make-shift area cash tickets. Everything pretty picked over, kinda sucked. Overall still fun, I sure I back play games!
The service Pittsburgh location incredible awful I actually took time day write online disappointed I was, I never done before. It Saturday night someone works restaurant im sympathetic comes service. We sat high tables bar area get greeted even acknowledged 30 minutes. I personally get manager explain situation treated like I stupid (maybe im 17?) Also mention little girl next balling eyes told server egg allergy still managed mess give food marinated egg. Last I overhead heading hospital. I'm writing message spiteful, I'm writing hopes future restaurant improve. There's big difference service hospitality right place lacking both. My best wishing improvement
Can get maintenance man? And janitor? And manager? No? Ok... I good time Dave Buster's, based mainly company I kept venue. We went right opened day, intention playing pool. We located pool tables area looked closed off, went hostess stand ask. She radioed help, got none, finally went search answer question. When came back, said couldn't find anyone, manager would talk us. We wait...and wait...and finally give go play arcade area. All one card purchase machines rebooting, one could use didn't work. It takes forever finally gives directs us non-existent ticketing attendant. So go search someone help. We flagged server, issued us card ($56 375 tokens) served us cocktails (average prices, though rum coke teeny). And play games. About every third game tried broken way. Either token swipe didn't work game messed up. It also wasn't cleanest place I've ever seen. They tables around place set drinks on, didn't look though they'd wiped day (which course makes wonder last cleaned games germy little kids touch day). Overall, appeared completely unprepared opening (computers booting, employees ready work, soda gun bar assembled, etc.) well maintained managed all. The broken games sort comical while, definitely good way. If really looking type activity, I'd try different location sure.
Luigi's everything I expected be. A decent place order authentic looking tasting pizza. I usually prefer New York style Luigi's offers slice. I also ordered lasagna daily lunch menu . I think least 6 regularly featured menu items choose drink included. Luigi's large dining area customers walk take counter choose.
I always go either eat dinner drinks .never problem food drink.sometimes play games sometimes.the girls behind counter nice even one guy Brett also nice.he works hard see well girls work . even one girl behind counter dressed nice.when go know like eat drink. Although restrooms cleaned little more.
Wednesday's half game night. Menu includes meals also provide ten dollar game cards. It's loud crazy that's expected. The kids love place. It's ok. Not thing I understand fascination.
im fan I went one October 2014. I town favorite nfl team colts steelers game. I went game fun city. I went half Wednesday. I really fun games. im young man I like old Nintendo games. I like kinds games. skee ball game acted up. I fun I go back. one miles far I go ohio one. im fan
My orders come bad pretty much every time I ordered here. The chicken nuggets come par. I'm lucky fries come right. My last experience last straw. I recently posted photo Chicken Ranch Club. That chicken. This ridiculous. I done going Mcd's.
I ate lunch today wife 2 kids. Server prompt getting table, took order disappeared. Our food took 25 minutes yet 4 table people dining. Grilled cheese, salad quesadilla shouldn't take long. Games fine. Mens room didn't paper towels dry hands with. Huge fail type venue.
I Dave Busters multiple times feel 2 star place. I say food quality sub par. In opinion food prices expensive quality. They offer nice bar,but prices opinion little higher. Service isn't bad, could better. D&B great place adults sure, prices tokes "game play" little ridiculous. Some games charge 6.9 credits place. Thats almost saying $1.50 game games addicting I know us keep playing. I also thing D&B isn't cleanest place either. The bathrooms near arcade always nasty opinion. Doesn't seem like keep it. To me, thats big factor rating restaurants. All all, D&B ok place visit, place would frequently waste money.
Delivery slow even close best Chinese area. No matter it's rice noodles chicken pork, everything tastes off--like it's overcooked mop-bucket-water. Try House Lee instead.
This wasn't cleanest place. Dirty paper towels women's bathroom. No changing covers changing tables change Babies. Very disappointed I came compared two I've too. Also aren't following corporate policy. Which ok, I asked one managers way out, said didn't honor first responders discount like stores do. Which ok Is fine, sore attitude towards them. Very disappointed attitude anything.
The food awful. I came small group people dinner one night heading bar hopping places Waterfront. We gave server benefit doubt 8 us, challenging. I think long wait time get drinks food due bartender kitchen, waitress really tried best. I gave 2 stars I liked mac cheese. Everyone else table hated food. They sandwiches dishes. The one girl resorted eating toppings sandwich bread hard bite through. The kitchen probably made sandwich right away left heating lamps 40 minutes preparing rest table's food. I tempted stop play games couple minutes, husband came restroom told 5 guys walked restroom well washed hands immediately went start playing games. All I say thanks.
Wow. What shame. My family moved area sampling local cuisine. We large family love foods kind. We've eaten Chinese food hundred different places dozen different cities. Hands down, worst we've ever had. Cold, tough, congealed, tasteless - that's way describe it. I'll never order again. Quite frankly, fact I took time away kids type tell awful was. My complaints fell deaf ears. I guess shocked someone thought serving low grade dog food. I understand sometimes restaurants crank bad food. It happens. But does, bend backwards make right. Not place. I told would speak owner order help me. I guess that's deflect complaints - blame owners aren't make customer away angry. Too bad. Because visiting competitor future. This family 7 won't visiting China Sea ever again. Oh, way, can't I give place zero stars?
The food good Waited hour drinks 1.5 hours food hour bill. Won't back! Not busy sure problem was. I'd hate "busy".
The pros: You get TON food money. If food actually decent, would even better because... LEFTOVERS. They coupons website use whenever. The cons: The woman answers phone kinda rude. You try ask questions gets attitude like you're wasting time. My pork dumplings "fried" one side raw middle. Everything pretty darn salty. Yeah, I get it. Chinese food tends little salty, unacceptably salty. Leftovers... Yes also con I threw away. Suffering enough! If you're craving something made fresh spicy sweet, you're going find here. Just greasy, salty, poor excuse Chinese takeout.
Worst service I've ever had! waited hour food. After waitress walked 6 times without saying word refilling drinks got manager come apologize give us round never said word food. And told us help never showed up. We waited another 30 mins food asked check 2 drinks got. We left nothing even said never got food. No apologies nothing. While sitting noticed 2 parties walked well. They didn't even get drinks. I would recommend go never sit eat. Drink play games fine. I never order food again.
Went Dave busters eat.... NO FOOD. Went Dave busters play.. NO GAMES. Then I thought I'd wet whistle cool glass H2O..they even RAN OUT OF WATER... Some lady even yelled line purchase game tickets accusing cutting line. SUCH HOSTILITY. dave busters? More like BEAVIS & BUTTHEAD. SMH
This place I'd go games. The food bad. I chicken sliders two pieces wood sandwich I found mouth. Granted manager take price sliders everyone's fries lukewarm. My sister got chicken fingers wow, zero flavor seasoning it. The bathrooms smelled like stale urine floors sticky. The waitress nice overall wouldn't dine again.
I sad see bad reviews I love D&B. However, I weekend dinner went midway. The food wasn't bad service overwhelmed didn't really server, couple small errors order. The bathroom wreck, like always. The trash always full, floors filthy, smells strongly urine. Half games I played wouldn't read card first try. Bartenders slow & didn't seem care, except manager. I'll back sure place needs serious staff updating.
If 21 must accompanied 25 year old. Not stupid rule, staff rudely expressed smirked us 21. Awful place rude people.
If play games, great deal fun, also fantastic place catch sporting event. If eat, maybe try somewhere else. I tried eating several occasions find part terrible. Nothing tastes like fresh all. I would guess everything delivered frozen either deep fried heated microwave. I can't think meal I've ever finished either bland plain lousy. Even 11 year old, loves wings chicken fingers (2 staples here) thinks food terrible refuses eat here, even though loves play games. My advice, eat somewhere else head play.
Horrifying. This place ashamed itself. DO NOT STAY HERE. Beyond dirty, absolutely rank.
4pm Friday afternoon I got turned away 8 days 21 I intention drinking 4 people place even I 21 I would go rivers downtown it's like put wristband saying I'm 20 anything.
worst service wver asked someone come 3 times sat table 20 minutes whole swarm servers walking around passing us. mention alllll tables whole game room dirty. even managers saw us sitting didnt bother greet us. drinks took forever wasnt busy bartenders didn't care much stood awhile. still go try eat. need structure work atmosphere.
OMG wrote review below? A big fat liar/someone paid write that! I stayed hour past weekend (my friend I intoxicated figured laying hours would get us better suited finish driving home). This place looks like hasb't cleaned (or furnished) since 80s. Literally grime walls, squashed, unwiped bug smears too. Ok, best, two hours, could deal. We looked bed bugs, didn't see immediate signs them- laid rest. After 20-30 minutes, started itching like crazy. I ran bathroom mirror (there mold bathroom) saw bed bug bites shoulders, arms, legs. HORRIBLE!! PLEASE Health Department, shut down! It's deplorable there!!
My sisters I always gone together ourselves. I 18 sisters younger I am. As walked in, would let us go unless 21, 21 someone 25. I called manager & told always rule, even though website says 18. Which I was, I allowed in. The manager ended hanging me. They turned something teenagers place adults. I extremely disappointed staff manager delt return specific Dave n Busters.
I can't even rate place! Its absolutely disgusting! I begged health department shut down! I forced stay night disgusting! I woke bed bug bites body! Just filthy! DO NOT STAY HERE!
Had fun playing games drinking here! Lots games prizes. Great atmosphere including DJ! On side note, creepy middle aged man came wife asking gets us certain amount tickets game (which pay for) buy alcoholic beverage. What world wrong man?!?! Couldn't find management workers advise walked away avoided rest night.
Got bit . Bed bugs wouldn't believe I show bite marks .. Even refused acknowledge
The service terrible. Games games Dave & busters service makes breaks place. I understand busy tonight fight, that's excuse rude employees... Especially multiple employees, hostesses, waitresses, bus boys. The manager hand great gave us reasonable explanation server rude. Either way, Saturday night, I wouldn't recommend going here.
Nina manager Ashley cashier extremely RUDE. refused give back change kiosk malfunction. made leave I girlfriend 20 I 23. supposed rule someone 21 needs someone 25. rule 3 size font. highly recommend one ever goes here.
Worst service ever food either cold ordered. Waited hour food well. Our service awful well. Bathrooms disgusting un-kept. I don't think I one good thing say place.
I got pedicure here. Not bad, pretty thorough. But two days later big toes infected oozing pus trimmed toenails sides (which weird anyway). I hate rate local shop down, man toes hurt.
I basic pedicure Star Nails Bellevue afternoon horrible. I rushed polish wasn't even hard yet. The woman insisted putting sandals ruined one big toe. She nail stooping dryer going leave gouged polish underneath repair. I said I wanted fixed. She did, polish stain around nail polish rough. When I got home, I noticed toenails rough cheap polish, even though OPI. The person next got leg massage much better service price pedicure. At $27, places I've absolutely unacceptable. While place looked clean, stylist's rolling cart not. If I could give negative stars, I would.
I know reason coming food, ridiculous. The five us sat one tables around bar game room. We still didn't napkins cutlery appetizer (nachos) came, asked some, please. She brought pile beverage napkins. When pointed problem went away eventually came back with....more beverage napkins. It little messy, managed fingers. Still didn't cutlery proper napkins food came. The woman brought food didn't think job get us, weren't going eat salads pasta fingers, eventually walked around hunt waitress, who, fifteen minutes food, finally delivered tools eat it. That also first opportunity point one us ordered salad, delivered pasta dish, completely unrelated, instead. Fifteen minutes finally delivered salad actually ordered. But that's worst. One pasta dishes *had* ordered arrived without sauce, naked pasta. We don't know why. Despite pointing problem, never anything that. Maybe thought easier eat fingers way. Anyway, don't try eat here. Just come play games, skip food.
So, I nails done Thurs Sat afternoon index finger chipped. I've work anything strenuous. I disappointed experience I don't think I'll returning.
How ridiculous arcade game company turn away kids. I drove 40 minutes take younger brother Dave Busters fun afternoon denied. Their policy states anybody age 21 must accompanied adult age 25. I'm 22 years old I don't understand I can't bring 12 year old brother play games. We've gone many times year past 15 years. After todays experience, I going back, whether I kids not.
If negative star would selected worst rating. 2.5 hour wait cold food served. Did enough staff kitchen never bothered provide updates. Bathrooms atrocious. Nothing positive say don't go there.
We stopped drive -thru last night helping sister move. It midnight thankfully something open. I ordered nuggets fries frosty. My sister ordered Bobby ordered two Jr. Bacon cheeseburgers. Well one burger bag (we found halfway Down road) Bobby said burger dry forgot mayo, & sisters fries salt lso says.. Mine fine I kept avoid eating mine. Typical older sibling.) Anyways I don't normally review fast food I've bad experience bc happens often, totally forgetting burger cool..
TERRIBLE! No one expects fast food gourmet, experience would make corporate cry! Ordered food 2 adults (full meals) one child charged 2 adult meals, I asked amount high employee said nothing me, looked way yelled manager. Still feeling charged wanting agitate situation left 1 less drink ordered, cold food soda water instead sprite one changed syrup. Never again.
We keep expecting food better last time. I've enough. Ordered two spicy chicken combos yesterday around 5 o'clock. You'd think food would fresh dinner-time rush. Well, you'd wrong. The sandwiches fries lukewarm, chicken filets dry tough must sitting heat lamp hours. We ordered unsweetened iced tea Sprite ice. Received unsweetened tea ice cup ice Sprite it. We've previously treated rudely gall use drive thru 20 minutes closing time. I'm trying remember ever served satisfactory meal there, I'm trouble coming single example. I assume manager never incompetent defy belief. This location coasts solely reputation Wendy's. Do favor. Go Burger King McDonald's road, hike Wendy's West View Park.
Apparently it's socially unacceptable continue going Chuck E. Cheese you've reached puberty. This I learned hard way. Fortunately, geniuses behind Dave & Busters got back. Sometimes I need escape stress adulthood rounds skee-ball (don't judge me). I work amount variety games, could definitely better. I would suggest coming Wednesdays half-price games get bang buck! Be aware obnoxious guests. I expect children bit rowdy, even adults suddenly forget socially acceptable behavior throw arcade. I come D&B games food. Aside horrible customer service I've experienced, food also tastes generic mediocre. For prices they're charging, worth it. Save bucks find better meal elsewhere.
Worst fast food I've ever to. A couple years ago, nice place. It took long time someone answer drive thru guy working drive thru hard understand like food mouth basically clueless. Once order finally understood, took long time get food. I thought overcharged, rather deal clueless gentleman I decided move on.
They kept trying staple poor dogs infected wound. After taking another vet, I educated wound care. After treated properly, healed quickly.
For 20 years Avalon Veterinary Hospital staff treated pets: cats, rabbits, fish, turtle. The prices reasonable, I've never charged follow-ups. Dr. Fitzgerald provided affordable diabetes treatment plan cat prolong life; prognosis went months three healthy years. When cat suddenly kidney failure diabetic shock, I charged treatment--not emergency appointment fees. The staff extremely considerate cat passed--some knew even crying. My cat gained reputation menace. But staff never complained--not even required four people hold get shots. When I sold diseased turtle child, Dr. Moore kind charge visit medication. He recognized interest science patiently answered 11-year-old questions. He even showed made slides microscope worked. (I later studied biology worked lab tech, thanks.) Dr. Moore also took exemplary care rabbits, lived unusually long lives. On practical note, require ALL animals cage leash. I well-behaved cat, sick chase dogs, wrapped blanket since collar would open wound...But generally enforce cage/leash policy safety animals. There small parking lot next clinic usually park pretty easily cross-street.
Despite asking specifically appointment Peter's Township office, scheduled visit Bethel Park physician's assistants, doctors. Was told don't opening Bethel Park nothing. Can't say much office managed way. The lack empathy even disturbing.
The doctors knowledgeable staff call center rude accommodating. It also convenient get appointment. I waited hour half seen I patient office. The drug reps came food I guess patients don't matter.
Where begin. I guess I'll start taking last cat two years ago I worried sick. He cried constantly I left sight. I assumed trying tell something I brought AVH seen before. The vet simply wrote "meows much on" chart prescribed Valium. Hoping get different vet next time I took cat there. Everyone always kind loving him, always takes vet least 40 minutes past appointment time see him. Not mention, always overbooked I forced sit waiting area least 4 barking dogs once. Their owners try calm them, cat shudders shakes cage I unable hold comfort him. You try holding scared cat room full dogs. I won't returning AVH.
Someone named Teresa erroneously gave practice cell phone number. The staff practice repeatedly called cell phone course week ask person, even I told time wrong number tried clear up. Worse yet, I POLITELY told staff member time problem, RUDELY slammed phone hung up. The staff practice needs lesson professionalism courtesy, needs mark file indicate wrong number listed. Don't take person incorrectly calling.
Fresh good...but I starving. I obviously returning since I favorable memory. I must say, though, spicy chicken sandwich fresh-out-of-the-fryer hot crispy bun toasted. The french fries also fried artery clogging perfection.
Do take pet here! If new don't bother establishing relationship. If past, warned, it's new ownership doctors vet techs decades gone. Prices increased dramatically new owners. My pet's annual visit well $100. Outside annual exams office visits $50 include anything may (shots, tests, blood work) exclusive hazardous waste disposal charge. Also, quit carrying lot medicines clients forced use mail order pharmacy. I loyal client Avalon Vet whole life, changes I've seen past year absurd. Prices increased, cameras everywhere, hiring vets decades bad reputations around area. Not mention I argue manager get copy pet's records. The last thing establishment, new owners, cares client's pets. Also, take Facebook page seriously. They censor it, removing anything slightest bit negative, paint completely different picture are.
It took hour get food everyone else got food five minutes. They forgot two drinks one employees said cuss word infront child.
So I'm laundry lazy, rainy afternoon I'm snuggle nap, I go basement put laundry dryer found basement floor covered raw sewage. So, Friday night, 5pm....yeah right...who's gonna even bother answering? These guys did. Ed hour. He professional (he even put booties feet coming house), explained exactly described problem prevent happening future. And guess what! He CLEANS TOO! Now, back laundry....what way spend Friday night.
They NOT care animals. I taking bothof dogs 4 years regular veterinary care. My youngest dog came stomach cancer I unemployed, needed euthanized I made appointment, put poor bloated sick dog car took final visit. They demanded I pay front even seen vet I asked billing, years-long patient always paid I didn't think would issue, especially considering pain dog in. They refused euthanization would rather leave sick animal (years long animal patient theirs! ) pain suffering courtesy sending bill regular customer. DISGUSTING. Who that? Never I take another animal there, I new vet actually cares animals feel whether pain. UPDATED FEB 2016: Owner veterinary practice finally figured Yelp contacted details experience. I provided necessary information harassed implying dog regular patient years didn't visit. Well no, good health didn't need seen. Regardless seen least 5 times since 2008. That considered vet. She insisted dog HAD euthanized (SHE WAS NOT ) asked change remove Yelp review even though I asked please stop contacting I didn't want emotionally relive HORRIFIC experience every time contacted me. I changing review I removing it. This review truth happened. So gives little insight business run, it. PS: Check Google Reviews sad stories also Search Avalon Veterinary Clinic Pittsurgh Facebook yet another horror story another patient October 2015.
Please please read! They care animals, all. They used owned wonderful people, owned people care money animal. We took dog surgery bladder stones less 2 months later died "full cancer"! How vet miss blood work performed surgery dog?? Shady me! After surgery, dog fell ill, took seen, obvious dire condition. The vet testing recommend taking dog speciality hospital, needed sonogram don't equipment. It obvious someone needed look inside dog see matter! Did vet know uneccesary tests make money? Either way result same. Please I want save someone awful pain happened me.
We used rdn plumbing recommended aha (american home shield) help fix clogged drain. A guy named Justin came helped us. After left drain unclogged pipe sink leaking. We left country vacation swamped construction afterwards. We called aha recall rdn come back fix leaking pipe. I woke 830 justin screaming (and mean screaming loud alarmed bed earplugs in). He questioning husband waited 3-4 weeks call in. After husbad explained country implied thAtmy husband messed pipes himself. My husband stayed calm told needs fix problem putting pipes back together correctly. THEN husband askd could call aha see leaking faucet would covered. He went truck called came barging back wrench started fixing faucet literally turning wrench twice. He told husband turning wrench wasnt covered. My husband tried get im stop wanted know covered. Justin freaked wrote whole new work order. He gave us bill stormed off. The even wrote statement "i going told job". I never seen temper tantrum called professional life. I als would like add NEVER left 1/5 stars service professional strangers house remodeing.
Unfortunately Dr. Ann's response review accurate account occurred. It amazes fact people justify actions. I'm wondering recommended sending Abby home iv? My father ask take Abby could get care needed. Only then, performed unnecessary tests tell specialty hospital. The care provided dog awful I hope one go thru did. I stand original post. This vet money. Yes, anger play role....what Abby family would make anyone angry. Look reviews...they common theme.
If way give stars I would. Horrible service. Was given time frame 45-50min delivery, waiting hour called told food way sent delivery guy 6 orders. After another 30min called back told pizza still ran part order. They said they'd bring right away. Waited another 20min live 1.5 miles away place still nothing. So called back asked money back. They never apologized every phone call trying talk another person whole different matter. And oh since used card it's going 3-4 days see refund. At least pay cash don't show know won't ripped least.
If want terrible pizza go here. Save money go buy frozen pizza better place
Ordered hot sausage Parmesan hoagie ,fried zucchini cheese steak hoagie, NONE edible. I cannot believe still bad were, establishment stick pizza only! Not worth one star!! Yuch!
Horrible beer, horrible service, horrible menu
I think ridiculous say need clients! I ready new client. I 12:30 appointment them, I arrived 12:30 dot, place locked dark one there! I waited five minutes (in rain), still didn't show. I called left voicemail saying I still willing wait, I understood confusion, could call cell (I gave number, I previously given home number I made appointment). I waited nearby coffee shop, went back another five minutes, still locked I hadn't received call. And I definitely estimating time, either. I willing wait bit, I looked closely time phone sure I wasn't jumping gun calling leaving. Finally, I went day I got home, left voicemail HOME PHONE, I specifically asked call, saying, "Oh hi. Sorry missed me, I MAYBE two minutes late most. I hope haven't left, call back reschedule.' Seriously? When I waiting, another woman came door. I thought worked there, another client, also trying get in! When I told story another local business, women said I probably fourth person experience place. I couldn't believe it. This place worst, I never even stepped inside!
Now I'm picky hair, Mane Attractions bad I walked 15 minutes watching stylists work clients. I desperately needed haircut walked major trim re-shaping layers. First, girl counter said hair might "difficult" due length (it nearly long enough sit time) I would probably stand cut. Weird, okay. Second, one knew anything donating "Locks Love," I feel like salons aware things like that. I needed cut I went anyway. I watched two stylists I waited turn. One stylist told client whose hair cutting going something discussed "wasn't looking right." Ummm, okay. The stylist busy checking phone every three seconds notice yanking client's hair hard comb giving poor client whiplash. At point, I pretended like I received urgent text said, "I leave, sorry "as I bolted door.
everytime come stick nachos add chicken add side guac i've never dissappointed. sit bar, grab drink 2 eat nachos. bar pool table plenty flatscreens. rock bottom chain it's one better chains area. i'll pass chili's friday's come rock bottom instead. oh typically walk target - work nachos.
Lately, Rock Bottom hit miss. The beers always good Uppity Jagoff IPA one best India Pale Ales I've ever tasted. The low point lately food. I never forgive idiot management took chicken quesadilla menu. That said, I ordered lobster roll arrived, bread hard brick cold. The filling okay, lobster flavor masked spicing. I suggest eat somewhere else imbibe Rock Bottom.
Cookies aren't bad. Haven't reason buy cakes pastries. Staff friendly smells like heaven.
Lincoln Bakery makes delicious donuts, pastries, desserts. Their bread selection, however, limited upon making choice quality bread mediocre. We also disappointed many things shop labeled store busy difficult find staff explain different options are. Still, go local bakery looking something sweet.
Got key lime pie place. It horrid. Icing stale cake thick, crust even crunchy taste, key lime weak. Pie looked sitting day 2.
On October 11 2014 I placed 140.00 order tortes cookies picked following Saturday told problem. I placed order girl taking order new another girl helped attitude poor told I put deposit pay 10.00 trays cookies don't tray tortes. I told fine I paid order full. following week I showed order never placed nothing. No manager owner could reached poor girl waiting shook up. The Girl attitude week suppose place order nasty insisted different name.Long story short make shift order put sarcastic counter girl. I return place again. I using years never saw business run like this. My daughters worked years well known bakery college said never left alone like this. Unfortunately man beside came pick cupcakes childs birthday paid experienced exact thing I did. Shame Lincoln run bakery like this. Oakmont Here I come. Oh cookies I got trays 4 dozen sugar cookies looked same. girls took order one whispered wondering would fired smart mouth answered don't worry stuff like lady needs get it!
Dirty slick holds. Hate fact I can't move mats. Some problems fun, awful. The staff unfriendly. Unless you're part clique one talk you.
Sub-par setting quality, infrequent wall resetting, inconsistent grading, poor climate control, poor air quality (no chalk filter), silly rule make everyone wear paper wristbands entry. + 1 star finally installing air conditioning.
Pros: - At least there's climbing gym area - Walls get reset often Cons: - I've coming couple times week past months now, I felt like walls really need padding besides not-so-great spring board have. The walls pretty high height + lack mats retract climbing certain routes, really disappointing ruins climbing experience. - I brought aforementioned lack mats woman works here, snapped me: "Mats supposed walls sloped." I told wall I talking sloped, replied curtly "If don't feel comfortable climbing walls without mat, shouldn't even climbing them." I shock. Is way addressing climbers' legitimate concerns? Even isn't possible mats, could least told nicer way instead talking I knew nothing. - The gym closes 11PM Fridays. I usually go night close, staff passive aggressively starts turning gym lights around 10:50PM. I get it, it's Friday night want get outta here. But business hours 11PM, let enjoy last ten minutes climbing I paying climbing membership I want get much climbing I get sessions gym. - The holds old covered rubber shoes. It would nice could least pressure wash every while. - The fees unreasonable customer experience get here.
Worst climbing gym I ever to. Customer service joke. Wall appears boy scout went ham sheets plywood back 80s nothing since then. Holds prehistoric grimy. Setting subpar. Insurance doesn't allow people can't belay belayed? Better climbing outside building good pump..
The ventilation bouldering area terrible. Please install chalk eaters. People inhaling tons chalk lungs going get pneumoconiosis climbing gym.
Don't go. I got problems sounds car I spent $800 there. unbelievable!
They told charge 100 dollars hour. They worked 10 minutes wouldn't give My keys unless I paid 107 dollars. The second time I went I went minor repair I left car making horrible noise completely denied it. They wouldn't say it. I took another auto shop bent brake caliber completely rubbing damaging parts. It ended costing 300 dollars.The son scam artist.
I've eaten suggested numerous people, I totally disappointed service, food, place itself, I headed back......ever Save money, starve either would better option
Cafe Zinho cute little restaurant tucked away street corner Shadyside serves Portuguese food. Everything looked great menu, execution flawed meal. Also, dishes really Portuguese. For appetizers, got chicken livers portuguese bread pudding mushroom cream sauce. The chicken livers lacked flavor, unfortunate chicken livers tasty. The bread pudding pretty good though. Entrees were, whole, impressive. The lamb chops obviously cooked (we ordered medium rare, insides almost fully cooked). The duck breast people raved online tough sauce sweet. The seafood stew lacked flavor. The lamb burger also overcooked.
These people could care less. I still waiting washer dryer get fixed -its almost month I told don't even know technician return. The technician 4 times already. Each time supposedly something else wrong order another part. Miraculously part wrong (first week), They forgot order second part (2nd week), Part comes need suppossed part "another 3-5 days"(3rd week), Fourth week rolls "don't know" coming (thats distributor). When I ask ETA (because I wearing dirty clothes, I sick technicians coming back 5 times I already took week work meet people) cus.t service rep gets mad offers refund. (The washer warranty) They obviously don't want deal problems created. So I call distributor see part coming (yup, thats YOUR job Appliance Service Center!).
I used repair service years. When I scheduled repair washer dryer, I charged $278.14 30 minute call. I shocked price charged service call appliances dryer requires $9.99 part I told repair man washer needed cleaned! I informed I use afresh every month keep water lid open dry every use. He looked response, I charged $134.00 comment! Ridiculous. My husband builder/developer I assure them, never refer business them.
Rude, unprofessional, lazy. I service appointment scheduled would even come house see wrong washing machine. They insisted ordering parts washing machine ever even came look it. I'm sure guessing kind work convenient them, I assure convenient customer. The lady I spoke rude unprofessional.
I downtown Izzazu location several times (I yet chance check new digs, however) always left really pleased. I used waxing haircut services complaints. In areas, girls I worked took time listen beginning work I ended exactly I looking for. I always got compliments hair getting cut. As price - stylists tiered different price scales. I asked phone making appointment surprises. After trying many salons didn't make cut (yay puns!) ending bangs, mullets, horrible cuts, I sticking Izzazu.
I've going Izzazu long time, almost 7 years now. I ALWAYS gone Cesare never stray him! The first time I went him, I 18 years old crazy red, blond black hair. He really helped go back natural color without damaging hair (even color stripping!) He always knows exactly I want, isn't afraid give suggestions liven look. He literally best color cut city. And believe me, I've done crazy stuff hair lot hair dressers. The atmosphere hip/chic makes feel like celebrity I go there! Also, I LOVE product line. I still use Izzazu leave-in conditioner, hairspray dry shampoo, even spending half year away Pittsburgh school. The loss one star goes attitude reception. I understand compelled people give 1 star, IS salon, meant cosmetic services. You aren't going reception. But, It wouldn't hurt smile little less brash.
Emailed called several times get pricing several services done graduation present myself. I put hold twice never picked back up. Emails went unanswered. :( I going SO MUCH done, too!! Hair cut, color highlights, spa manicure/pedicure hour massage! All graduation present can't attentive prospective customers I can't imagine they'd attentive store. I'll spend money elsewhere!
Unbelievable experience! Literally unbelievable. I waited 50 minutes finally walked out. Receptionists beyond awful. I booked 3 style appointments advance wedding. One person taken right away, 20 minutes later second person taken. I WAITED 50 MINUTES ignored receptionists. I celled others almost done would running late. My stylist finally came said he'd quickly hair. What !! I'm paying $100 get rushed service. We looking forward relaxing, fun experience. More unbelievable, I waited 20 minutes pay two services. One receptionist couldn't take transactions another occupied wedding party. I close walking paying. Unfortunately two stylists didn't get tip fault own. I can't give unbiased opinion work I still furious way I treated. I would expect ambiance $100 shampoo & style. I could never recommend Izzazu. Denham & Company Market Square, rates reasonable within walking distance Fairmont. I calling concierge tomorrow informing experience.
I wanted find new place tried Wexford location since I live nearby seeing coupon haircut. OMG, I appointment weekend get hair fixed, though hard I went TRIM I lost 5 inches hair still uneven. My part left kinda zig zagged hair sticks over. I asked often hair cut I told much length helping get rid volume (I thick hair). Yea, well 3 inches cut hair wet 5 inches dry curly hair is, I mentioned oh, I don't know maybe 100 times b/c kept asking treatment straighten it. No wonder need coupons customers. And I still tipped bad I felt telling poor divorce. I walked I left waiting 30 minutes without anyone saying word it.
I arrived appointment 1 o'clock time sitting waiting half hour told stylist running behind would least another half hour could get me. I guess time current customer's time important mine. I didn't stay find haircut would gone.
Poor planning. I called made appointment, I driving appointment receptionist called said stylist flu (I completely understand people get sick). This going first time salon, way working schedule day all- I taken work appointment. If someone sick okay, able call way appointment and/or give another option different opening day.
I lived area Page's Dairy Mart 40 yrs. I always enjoyed ice cream until" this" day. I ordered artic swirl (chocolate ice cream chocolate chip cookie dough) I ordered item again. When I took first taste, chocolate chip cookie dough pieces, second taste, thing, third taste, thing approximately 5 6 tastes. I took cup remaining counter asked remake, I denied told would waste "their" money, nothing mine, I ordered expensive plain chocolate ice cream. They dumped medium cup small handed back me. Well wasn't even medium desert, since fit small cup. I even tipped girl $2 I first received desert. I never return, make purchases. I however return express disdain owner I find there. I hope reads this.
Can't go wrong place. We've times I always get thing (small chocolate ice cream cone) I'm reading reviews, NEED switch try something else. Plenty parking sweet little place.
I visited place last night bike ride, allowed feel less guilty small chocolate-dipped cone. I wouldn't call huge fan soft serve ice cream general, stuff serve incredibly smooth creamy! I've twice before, one times, I ordered chocolate chip cookie sundae, incredible! The warmth cookie hot fudge, coolness ice cream pure bliss. While last night, I saw sign window advertising cinnamon roll sundae--guess I know I'm getting next time! EDIT: Tried cinnamon roll sundae, given stale cinnamon roll. Also, didn't maple syrup day I ordered it, tasted weird butterscotch syrup. I'll sticking cookie brownie sundaes on. 4.5 stars.
It's average ice cream place. No more, less. You products taste Dairy Queen Tastee Freeze. People give place 5 stars like think they're special knowing small pop place.
I go back place! It's gem hiding old gas station. I cinnamon roll Sunday big amazing. I mean $4.25 big. I mean it's like size something Cheesecake Factory price 90s. They massive selection it's hard pick. If everything good I today I can't wait try something different every time I go back on. This place must try.
Page's...A Love Poem Oh Page's, How I love thee... With swirled frozen peaks And sundaes covered rainbow jimmies, Leaves smiling, cheek cheek. Page's regular family outing far back I remember clearly popularity doesn't stop family. From opening day closing find people willing line around block get ice cream fix. No ice cream location Pittsburgh even comes close rivaling outstanding soft serve experience. Our usual order consists basics: swirled soft serve (cup cone) dipped crunches jimmies. Not soft serve also wide variety insane sundae creations novelties. And don't forget shaved ice - comes basically ever flavor could imagine. Visiting Page's isn't ice cream, it's making pilgrimage quite possibly city's signature ice cream experience.
Okay I heard read place since moving side town finally came. Big waste time gas. They Do Not ice cream, soft serve. Well I ordered butter pecan 'ice cream' bring me? Vanilla! Wow servers lazy dumb?
Over-hyped. I thought Page's tasted like average soft-serve ice cream shop. I also surprised lack flavors offered, cookies cream sorbets. I ordered small Chocolate Chip ice cream rainbow sprinkles boyfriend ordered Strawberry Shortcake sundae. My Chocolate Chip ice cream tasted identical Breyer's boxed ice cream grocery store. I may ordered wrong item soft-serve ice cream don't offer samples. My boyfriend Strawberry Shortcake sundae 3 pieces cake bottom, 2 scoops vanilla ice cream, strawberry syrup, strawberries (not fresh), almonds whipped cream. It huge didn't allow swap flavors make adjustments. Maybe expectations Page's high, I heard ice cream shop whose line wrapped street I knew I check place out. When I went Friday night line ice cream sub-par.
This place isn't good. I ordered sundae asked flavored ice cream told could chocolate vanilla "how mix it". It's sundae mixing involved I don't understand that. Then I got it, missing half toppings listed description. Definitely good people claim. Won't going back.
This go-to hardware store. Wide inventory. Knowledgeable helpful. Quick service. Bonuses: This store family generations. Honesty hard work reflect old-fashioned business ethics. I enjoy feel place creaky old wooden floors. They give little extra pro-tips ask.
I driving little bakery several years always wanting stop try it. Unfortunately, usually closed I time stop. I finally lucky enough find open time I chance stop pop in. The cases less half full I found tad disconcerting asked lady behind counter empty. She said normally sell fare early day. Luckily, small yellow cake butter cream frosting. I ordered one took home. The cake good, wasn't good bakeries Pittsburgh Metro. I would never crave it, I would return bakeries closed time.
A good Family Dollar NOT! Every time I enter lackluster (and may I add DIRTY) location, 50/50 chance following: a) store half stocked, b) stock order arrived, meaning pleasure tripping pallets large dollies full unopened stock boxes everywhere (which includes right middle aisles). The regular cashiers rude flat gross (one time cashier "joking" killing ringing customers). The employees treat decently ones I notice years. The neighborhood disarray I find poor excuse Family Dollar location continuously poor condition, Rite Aid RIGHT NEXT DOOR location treats respect dignity. I forced keep visiting cesspool Family Dollar location solely convenience. I don't car next nearest Family Dollar 45 minute walk (a bit far need cold medicine dish soap). But bet second family obtains vehicle, "Family" kissing dollars goodbye!
Horrible - use chicken that's uncover day . And smoke around food.:(
Maybe I went bad night, service stunningly bad. Water glasses stayed empty almost 15 minutes! Ordered 5 dishes, pretty average. The tab: $300+. I won't back.
No better taste Fazoli even Olive Garden. Inflated prices, like cheapest entree $40, try disguise place something not. Went group co workers, pretty much got everything menu one thing stuck really good. Service incredibly slow. Not worth all. Even tell atleast portions large, food good enough warrant wasting meal eating there.
Seated bar made reservations week advance. That, paired mediocre menu overall experience, gives two stars. Save money stay town. I would probably send (gasp) Olive Garden I referred here.
The first time I went group - reserved entire restaurant retirement party. I horrible experience. Vowed never go back! At time, I even terrible interaction owner. This time I invited couple girlfriends love it. Decided try since "get together" food/location. This time, overpriced food bad service. Overall, anything ordinary worth price. I veal speciality. Large portion, ok. Staff attentive small amount customers present. I Pittsburgh native. This bad neighborhood. I NOT interested ever going back!
Crappy Place. Definitely worth price. Very small place. Didnt really ambiance found normal restaurants. I made reservation still table ready. I definitely going place again.
typical run mill Chinese take out...but must say, 3 moves around immediate south name change (theyre ABC Garden) i've stuck guys. never disappointing encounter them, even constant delivery staff changes. Their day combos huge amount food theyre $8. Also, I prefer lo mein sauce only, don't problems accommodating. anyone else order always seems issue gives gross vegetables too. little points along quick delivery makes go-to need quick noodle fix.
The name ABC Garden best Chinese food I've Pittsburgh. This place completely satisfies Chinese food craving I want balance fried deliciousness fresh ingredients. The neighborhood kinda dodgy since deliver (and quick, might add), need tread Sketchville pick delectable Chinese offerings. Also, free extras order $20 (such 2 liter Pepsi). Update: Much great sadness disappointment, I stop patronizing establishment due extremely rude unprofessional man hired answer phone. We tolerated first times, even got laugh fact actually dropped F bomb times taking order. But became hostile irate recent order, over. He started like always laughing street name spell 5 times, interrupted order without excusing set phone yell children I heard background, argued menu hand said, telling I wrong said something different. He aggressive, frustrated, impatient clearly psychological problems. I make painful decision give place spite lovely fresh vegetables tofu cooked perfection. :( I'm trying No. 1 Kitchen Brownsville instead.
Well, delivery fast least. Everything else yucky. Avoid!
I would recommend working dollar bank home mortgage. They jerked us around almost 2 months point switched 5/3 bank. 5/3 got farther 2 weeks dollar 2 months. Unfortunately us closing 5/3 seller unexpectedly passed away. Now wait see mode probate see still buy house. If dollar bank would done job would deal done happened. My new goal deter anybody I know away Dollar Bank. Their back office underwriting processing joke needs fixed badly. Save trouble avoid dollar bank costs
If wasn't fast affordable place It would stars all. I got fill fix I broke nail. First didn't cut nails obnoxiously long. Second thin I feel like going crack off. Not mention seems dirty.. I uncomfortable whole time I there. One nail techs constantly hitting me. I returning again.
Woke furnace working...called home warranty company TWG. TWG said company 'priority' Bryant repair contractor sent work order...I called told someone would call back...one hour later I called extremely rude woman told sent message TWG could take job. When I asked woman one called back said IT IS NOT OUR JOB TO CALL YOU BACK! Terrible customer service! Luckily Lakewood Mechanical Inc Campbells Run Road able get house make repair within hours. Call Lakewood..NOT STAAB AND SONS!!!
Not sure what's happened Staab I'm impressed happy. Our house's plumbing HVAC systems serviced exclusively Staab something like 40 years. They reliable, easy-to-work-with company. Now, they're "all business." Got seasonal service contract January ... couldn't get service June. Requested estimate leaking bathtub ... But got invoice three days I got estimate. And got past due "dunning notice" 6 days service call. Truly, don't need kind grief.
This would 5 stars aren't consistent were. My order usually always right..every time I get cheese lovers extra cheese days it's never there... There's 1 delivery driver come apartment building door. The others reason scared I meet sidewalk outside! They tend get busy, told delivery time would 2 hours. Otherwise it's Pizza Hut, tastes same, quality.
I ordered pizza location recently. When I went pick pizza, I waited 10-15 minutes anyone even acknowledged I there. I customer store, simply ignoring me. There two people back saw several times, yet never even stopped say, "We'll minute", ignroed me. About 10 minutes wait cashier/front store clerk came back door handful scratch lottery tickets obviously bought, rather put ring saw me, also pretended I wasn't walked somewhere, I assume, scratch lottery tickets. Needless say, I never going again.
My night ruined thanks Pizza Hut. I got 3 pizzas, one boyfriend, brother myself; first glance looked great, brother started eating pizza found hair made disgusted I continued eat anyway. When I found hair separate pizza made absolutely sick couldn't even finish 2nd piece. I find repulsive obviously cooks don't wear hair nets since MULTIPLE HAIRS pizza. This first real meal since getting wisdom teeth 3 days ago thanks ruining me. Its safe say don't think I'll ever ordering unsanitary, disgusting location !
I waited 1 hour 45 minutes pizza delivered. Then I got it, cold! I hungry refused eat stuff!
We don't order delivery Carrick location anymore, drive Brentwood want Pizza Hut. Yes it's inconvenient, it's better taking chances you'll get filthy, unorganized, slow location. Since health department hasn't gotten around shutting yet may I suggest calling doctor make sure current shots bite in. That get sold anyone place order first place. Years going learn news reason never took orders delivered friends called cellphones. When dropped pizzas going find dropping drugs! At least scenario makes sense.
Ordered online Pizza Hut 9:39pm, routed store. Estimated delivery 10:09, tried calling 10:44 (store "open" 11) received message store closed. Checked credit card statement, charged refunded. I'm guessing didn't feel like delivery even bothering notify me. I won't business store franchisee's stores again. The franchisee apparently Aurora Huts LLC, owns 55 (all?) Pittsburgh area Pizza Huts.
It's pretty average Chinese food. Their egg rolls dumplings decent enough Hawaii Five O dish I ok too. The service little slow well.
This worst Chinese food I long time. The Crab Rangoon clunky thick. There crab inside-it cream cheese. The egg roll I dripping grease filled cabbage nothing else. There veggies anything. The Sesame Chicken mushy time I got home I live 5 minutes away. It mushy breading little chicken. I ate 3 bites threw away. This meal EPIC FAIL.
Heyyyy everyone. Im gonna try start again! So im new around side town thought i'd try Chinese restaurant around corner. I call order small general tso's white rice . The menu see online tells 7.54 says phone 8.25(assuming thats tax) something like Then tells take 10mins get 6 mins already done . So know fresh. Then go pay says 9.58. Which annoying. But long rant food wasnt fresher side, looked dry, BUT really good flavor! isnt spicy thats youre looking idk dont sizes small good Lord idk large would look like. Im adding pics. Flash flash UPDATED menu.
Had chicken salad. Was good pricey. Their pizza 20-30% expensive comparable pizza area. And since pizza mediocre definitely good value I'll pass!
They never open Sundays... even though supposed be.. I starting think maybe folded business
Yesterday I misfortune getting pizza Bishops. It first time getting pizza long time. Needless say. I won't getting one again. I got pepperoni sausage pizza. The pizza bland , tasteless. Crust tasted like frozen pizza crust. The sauce meh. Cheese okay. Sausage disgusting. Bishops used use delicious hot sausage. I don't know sausage disgusting. I don't recommend getting pizza Bishops
Not sure people talk bad place. I business deliver get food least 2 times week. Might little ore money worth every penny. Ignore bad reviews here. This place one best food places there..
The customer service absolutely horrible. They made wait hour anybody got me, 3 available beauticians back. I complained got waited right away. I thought customer always came first. Why would want risk customer coming back. I mean I go road Borics. These women old middle aged miserable employees passion jobs. I won't back. DISAPPOINTED...:(
Open 24hrs Friday Saturday love it. Total old school mom pop diner. Wouldn't recommend anything breakfast. On top everything else cost nickels dimes eat here. After you've blown money bar southside you'll still enough eat away drunkness way home.
One weekly lunch breakfast place. Good home cooked food reasonable prices. I would avoid busy times. An Sunday mornings. The staff limited cannot handle full crowd. I never problem usually, except today glass milk chunky( turned sour ). Sadly Shirley passed missed.
Frank & Shirley's staple family breakfast. I going since I child parents take children there.
Good breakfast, horrible service.. And im even one complain service. One waitresses always bad mood attitude. Fire ill raise rating solid 4
I've one experience Frank & Shirley's, enough last. I didn't even get sit I disgusted place. While waiting seated, man came kitchen toilet plunger hand, went unclog toilet. Afterwards, without washing hands anything, walked back kitchen, still carrying plunger, dripping entire way. I absolutely horrified! I never ever consider going back there.
DO NOT GO HERE FOR SERVICE ON YOUR BIKE. I dropped bike oil change calling ahead time (11am). They told one ahead service. I called back end day told bike couldn't get looked next day! When I questioned oil change wasn't done didn't services ahead mine, rude incompetent guy runs service department told "I busy stuff". From I taking business elsewhere place joke.
Maybe I bad day. This THE WORST "pizza" I've ever had. I Original DiCarlo's Wheeling, WV several locations. This even worthy name. I got 3 extra cheese. First off, pizza basically glued wax paper. The crust unevenly cooked. First bite crust almost raw, dense, way chewy. The sauce tasted sour cheese (shredded, dices provolone like Original) slimy. My second bite, crust burned, tasted burned, least crunchy. There third bite. The remaining slices got tossed garbage. This far worst "pizza" I've ever had.
1 Do business company The owner thief. He send pink notices look like bills instead service packs attempts get enroll. The service awful, follow issues non existent,the company give 7 day notice suspend POS license even questioning invoice shut entire business. The techs part time walk business can't address issue push another part time tech... Save aggravation... I FUTURE POS AND BOUGHT THE LICENSES SO IM STUCK!! go direct dealer Butler PA.. This company's worst can't even keep employees... They 2 techs company one incompetent other...you warned!!!
If zero option would rate them! They worst company ever deal want money! I called tec support get back office un-locked said would $600 already bought system $4000
Zero opinion. Worst POS company Pittsburgh deal Cutting Edge Solutions Butler POS company NCR/Aloha.
The service hit-or-miss, often not, I don't problems. Usually, friend I stop by, we're waited server, food comes relatively quickly. It's always fresh, too. Unfortunately, get busy, creates problems don't stock anything prepared, turn creates delays. Their cashiers habit walking away counter evening, leaving customers waiting however long takes notice someone standing there. While I understand clean restaurant closing, always someone watch counter. As side note, drive-thru speaker went month ago still hasn't repaired. It creates delays drive-thru window placing orders, especially later evening due mentioned cashier habits.
My sister I used love going Anthony's Pizza. It staple Carrick 40 years. Recently changed ownership sadly results horrific. We ordered 8-cut (medium) pizza anchovies. The problem quantitative. They appear using original recipe however amount dough, cheese, sauce literally 40% less used be. Anthony's always thin crusted pizza, paper thin! I've making pizza years best pizza restaurants Pittsburgh lifelong resident I know good pizza expected terms sizing. One piece small literally fit within palm hand (fingers excluded!) - shocked. To compound misery, sister called explain, rude - polite, yet honest firm, woman co-owner condescending sarcastic asked thought pizza could made better! My sister calmly explained amount dough cheese used less half medium sized pizza. The worst thing, really reflects woman's character business ethics, offer apology! Not even simple "I'm sorry." That outrageous inexcusable. This small inconsequential complaint, serious issue, yet didn't even phase her. Also didn't offer us refund, didn't offer remake pizza, offer us sort discount future purchases. Needless say never go again. It's shame Anthony's used great pizza (I reviewed old ownership.) could loyal customers years come. Oh I also note woman's 15/16 year old son, looks like experience cooking, cook! Even still watched make pizza closed box handed can't claim ignorance - phone incredulous. Also ambiance Anthony's same. They removed venerable booths replaced tables, took folk art collage main wall longer offer IBC soda. If keep ridiculously small portions I can't see staying business long. This Carrick, Sewickley Mt. Lebanon. People around expect value money tolerate doing. I urge everyone steer clear new Anthony's. CAVEAT EMPTOR!!!
Not good disappointed
Very disappointed. Wouldn't recommend all. Got large pizza. The quality horrible. The sauce good flavor all. I wait 2 hours pick crap. Their pizza box like diaper. The Pizza bagels soggy yet burned. The employees looked like bunch drug addicts hanging out. And Prices high. Biggest waste money!!
I'm glad back open! We missed guys! This greasy cheesy pizza exactly I like.
I ordered bacon pizza breaded mushrooms. Disgusting putting lightly. The hardly bacon pie pizza greasy soggy. The mushrooms burnt I bit one them, mouth filed grease. I threw whole meal garbage.
They upgrade take credit cards debit cards. A negative things place. They close 9PM week. I believe Summer extended hours competition yinz guys pizza block away. They open 11. They losing business. Even stayed open 10 would better. No air conditioning place. And everytime I call phone number goes straight voicemail saying another line call back. I never get person actually order anything.

We Groupon use The Park House. It included two sandwiches/entrees two sides. We pint beer dinner shocked received check: beer $44. I charged $22.50 Southern Tier's Choklat Stout. The size bottle retails approximately $10. That completely ridiculous. It also help beer prices listed. One star ridiculous overcharge. The food good.
I must admit, I like brews. I also like white cheddar mash potatoes. Other that, meh. The food pretty forgettable. Another "brewery" sadly fails anything special food department. With restaurants upping ante 8th Ave, may want kick notch Rock Bottom. But would anyone know to? It's chain. Whomp whomp!
For brewery attempting take advantage Oktoberfest wonder 7 pm could mashed potatoes & sauerkraut sausage platter sweet mustard guess Germany. Not worth $5.95 unfortunately sausage platter $15.95.
The reason Rock Bottom gets 3 stars brews. Food "eh", many vegetarian options hostesses ignore busy chatting didn't text back. This place potential great, sadly, falls way short almost areas.
Slow service Below average food Ill pass
First time I I chicken quesadilla's bad. We went last weekend. I chicken avacod sandwich. It good. No fat chicken. Just mess eat, still awesome. Also chocolate stout cupcake, amazing.
Came BF started crab artichoke dip. It greasy virtually crab. The wedge salad good crisp. I hazelnut crusted chicken. This one worst dishes I've ever like pancake syrup breaded chicken. To finish meal homemade chocolate chip cookies served hot fudge. Well hot fudge chocolate syrup ice cream crystallized melting re-freezing around disappointing.
The Cajun Pasta I ordered spicy enough keep sipping Rock Bottom IPA. It may chain I always get microbrew restaurant feel I'm here. They could upgrade quality servers I've never really bad experience service.
Poor service food. I waited 20 minutes bar someone acknowledge presence. They finally brought food left without asking pay.... So I wait additional 15 minutes find someone pay. Yes, I TRY give money. On important part... Food terrible. I burger pathetic.
Be careful. The servers can't pay attention save lives, management cares even less. I want make sure people know careless management is, particularly Mark seems let staff run around.
Was hoping great end day experience, but...... Things happen. Waitress seemed forgotten us, entrees came prior appetizers. Entree fish &chips major disappointment, fish soggy chips cold grainy.starters comp'ed I doubt we'd go back. Sad potential home run hitter. Two stars that's it.
Rock Bottom: A Cautionary Yelper's Tale. You might say, "I've never heard Rock Bottom, there's way chain restaurant." Beer? Apps? Bros? Sounds like good time, careful you'll end rock bottom. After 30 minute wait staring half empty restaurant usual goofy decor would find Buffalo Wild Wings, finally seated. We could feel tension diners something wasn't right. The manger running around apologetically food casually sunbathing heat lamps. We immediately ordered apps like GOT, watch begins. We waited waited finally receive saddest, tiniest plates food bloated chain restaurant prices. The food uninspired, tired, ordinary. The reason I giving 2 stars extremely gracious apologetic wait staff took 20% meal due terrible service. So decided take seat Rock Bottom, take comfort knowing even staff seems know pain.
While certainly first meal Rock Bottom, first meal year two . The wait minuscule, greeter pleasant. As always haircut weekend twin carnivores, mother law I decided tie feed bag RB. Our server Matt easy work informative. I started tortilla soup. Spicy thick went easy enough. However let say price $3.50 rather steep serving size. Did somebody say OUCH!! Thing one thing two 'small fry steaks' fruit (cantaloupe, melons, grapes) steamed broccoli $6.75 each, I think I 'buffaloed' IF get drift. The steak consisted three small thinly sliced pieces .... Hmmm. They say kids say darnedest things well thing one noticed steak gristly, thing two noticed rather dry. Not best dinner eaten. They say get pay OR NOT!! My meal consisted Chicken Bacon Mac & Cheese $14.75 I complaints. It filing hot load chicken bacon. How anything wrong much BACON!!! The final dinner consisted chicken fried chicken $13.95 mother law sated. Over meal wash. If anyone Rock Bottom corporate reads this... You may seriously want rethink portion sizes. As know I vote feet dollars, neither ANY time soon!!
This another one favorite places deteriorated dramatically. Corporate decided get rid core beers beers suck. The menu gone something everyone couple overpriced entrees bunch small plates ok great. The service also suffered tremendously. We abandoning restaurant. I don't expect Rock Bottom around much longer. In past, nights Pirates playing town, bar restaurant would packed. Last night, slightly busy. You usually tell eatery suffering amount staff given night conditions bathroom. The staff overwhelmed bathrooms filthy serious need repairs. Alas, I don't think Rock Bottom still business six months. Hopefully, happens, Black Rock Bar & Steak House find way Pittsburgh.
Very disappointing menu. Pseudo Mexican south border fare. I Beef Tip Sliders. What ridicules offering. Each one (2 plate) nickel sized piece beef oblong 3" bun. It taken back kitchen, I complained, thin sliver appeared. The thing good experience, waiter nice! As raven said, "Never, never more."
Great selection beers especially seasonal ones! You won't disappointed. The Jalapeño pretzels dope!
Ergh, place. I hate giving bad reviews latest visit, I listened gut repeated visit here. Naturally, I'm stranger chain, understand it's chain, past visit good. Came brother Sunday driving lesson. We hungry way paying gas money. We seated dining area. Every time seated dining area it's bad experience. On bar side get entertainment, beer flights/draft specials decent bar food/appetizers passable. It started soft drinks. I'm pop drinkers I want simple diet pepsi I expect taste funky [and yes, I prefer weird twang diet drinks sugar glass taste regular]. There incorrect carbonation, whether running [I suspect this], ice [lukewarm] hooked new box [unlikely]. I sent back. My brother got burger said fine, came egg found satisfied. I tried steal fries, failure. They tasted like brand freezer section [a full mouth starch], barely crispy enough. So abandon plan. On dish I classic mac n' chicken. First all, pasta crispy?, really?, wasn't cheese sauce, pretty much butter baked sprinkled Parmesan smothered breadcrumbs. And I say smothered here, good thing. Sigh. The chicken pushed bottom pan, brother tasted I turned version favorite dish, said cooked properly. A small save? Again - I sent back 3 bites. The waitress came back asking I wanted box, I told take away. She disappeared oblivion flag check, I didn't see brother paid I used restroom, I hope didn't charge us pop drink.... Needless say, I came home hungry. Honestly, come, come drinks salad, don't screw up. Everything else, avoid.
first bad experience place. double swiss burger tasteless could make. I asked medium cooked gave burnt. instead caramelized onions, added raw onions. check quality jalapeños use, hot all. also forgot add mayo. ohh took 50 minutes prepare burger, missed movie amc. waiter even bother ask everything okay. won't visit again.
We waited almost hour, groups smaller larger, arrived us, streamed out. When checked table status, replied "You 19 minutes" wait. I guess didn't matter I could see tons open tables sort seating timer. Once seated, waiter quick that's extent anything nice I say. The folks party mentioned burgers pretty good; however, Cuban Cristo mess. It much batter fried long, resulting greasy, brick sandwich. And, brewery, I extremely disappointed small size beer list. Overall, mediocre experience forgettable food. I won't going back.
Rock Bottom decent larger sports/brew pub seating premium weekend evenings, prepare wait hour seated table try luck scurrying others high-top becomes available bar. The food average, nothing extraordinary...we get sausage filled pretzels bites, little sausage half (should gotten ball park pretzel) They offer drink wine selection beer limited house brew only.
Very disappointed place. A lot people standing around, table menus sticky, food FUCKED!! Sent pathetic Bruschetta chicken back size chicken nugget one giant stem broccoli. Do come eat. 2 stars beer good.
Although proximity house adds convenience factor going Rock Bottom, food less desirable. The beer great, it's fairly clean establishment good wait staff, food IS AWFUL. I ordered quesadilla appetizer, $10.59 I got 4 mini tortillas, toasted all, melted cheese chicken. No salsa, lettuce, guac, sour cream. NOTHING. Then I hoping pizza I ordered would sort redeem experience, I got "hot" style pizza since I like spicy food. The small pizza probably 8 jalapeños worth peppers, sauce cheese. It underwhelming. I wish food could match quality beer. Real bummer.
If want rock bottom food, head Rock Bottom. Slow service, horrible, horrible food. Was served freezing cold enchiladas pizza. The enchiladas supposed chicken two tiny strips chicken I'm talking minuscule. Rice still cold served second time half hour later. Manager apologized waitress offered us something waited food second time. I don't know whose fault was, clearly problems house. I'll take blame ordering chicken enchiladas brewery wow, horrid!
Terrible customer service, disrespectful fact. I towed vehicle Master Muffler evening. The owner called 645 next day gave attitude leaving parking lot. He told wouldn't work vehicle I pick back end day. I said secondary vehicle I asked could fixed earliest convenience, said "it doesn't work like that". Never going back I would advise Master Muffler others.
I've twice now, like others really come Improve Comedy Club show. Very reasonably priced shows though two item minimum would suggest drinks. The food leaves little desired. We decided sake time grab dinner venue since show started 7. Having free appetizer coupon ordered spinach artichoke dip along sauteed grilled chicken. Spinach artichoke dip good though cheesy rich along cheese sprinkled top chips. Sauteed grilled chicken - hmmm.... I think chicken frozen - definitely fresh - guacamole artificial glop cheese. It looked like mess big ole pile fries. A lot food $10. Service always pleasant though automatically tack tip 18%.
The place best - Comedy. The food, however. Blah. First off, If go show, please note two item per person minimum. This means extensive menu overpriced bar food drinks, REQUIRED choose two items each. Second, sodas NOT FREE REFILLS! I learned one hard way. Get water. Third, tipping server, please make sure hasn't already taken cut out. Even paying two bland, overpriced meals way many Diet Cokes, I thought bill rather high. Upon inspection, I noticed server taken 18% gratuity. The menu explicitly says automatic gratuity taken parties six more, two us weren't even drunk. I found tactic awfully presumptuous left tip 18% even though I typically tip well 20%. Overall, I don't like idea required purchase food see comedy show. I see it, I required buy crappy popcorn overpriced pop every time I went movies, I would far less inclined go I inclined go Improv again.
We came Improv first time Friday night wife's work holiday party. We arrived early dinner drinks predetermined menu. Dinner started salad clearly bagged, almost brown iceberg lettuce, croutons frozen-then-thawed looking tomatoes pinkish best. I took bites unappetizing poor excuse salad, I tell downright tragic. Dinner arrived since wasn't vegetarian options predetermined menu, received dish supposed contain meat meat omitted. It huge pile spaghetti bowl. It looked sloppy tasted worse looked. The pasta overcooked, tomato sauce watered puréed canned tomatoes. I saw traces onion dish didn't taste all. I hungry I salted heck abomination took bites. Yuck. I didn't make dent crapfest. For dessert given choice chocolate cake, wife ordered, cheesecake, I ordered. The chocolate cake freezer burn. Inexcusable! It wasn't edible. The cheesecake hair better, obviously come freezer well. I know people aren't coming food, FORCING order things menu fulfill outdated requirements (two drink/two menu item minimum) least make halfway decent food. It doesn't even memorable...just OFFENSIVE. Which was!! Had I paid I would made huge stink, I tried polite push food around make small talk. The comedians good. The venue nice-ish got sit front arrived early "event". Not always best thing comedy club (we got picked little bit). But damn, I hungry! I found fantasizing crappy Waterfront restaurants I'd rather there...how I'd rather heating discount microwave dinner...how I'd rather giant bowl Captain Crunch...how I'd rather go back time eat spaghetti high school cafeteria...what dreadful dining experience. My car also violated parking lot. I adorable German license plate front adorable German car stolen I eating hideous food, slap face I wanted finally retreating car. I feel sick many different ways experience whole. The Improv consider outsourcing food prep catering company. I truly believe that's thing save place. Do favor eat beforehand, order beer. Well, two I guess. Other diners table complained quality cocktails I'd steer clear those. Unless can't miss type comedian here, I can't ever picture going back Improv. I'd give comedians 4 stars, food ZERO stars.
Jesse worked miracles altered complicated dress within days. He old school knows he's doing. So glad neighborhood!
I don't know I put tires long I live close place! I went Thursday morning. Dropped car walked across street get coffee. As soon I came back done! Not even 10 mins. These guys best! Not expensive either don't try sell "bells whistles" tire places try sell (ehem mr. Tire). I quoted price around $700 tires places discount tire got $360. From on, I won't going anywhere else tires!
Almost tires sold site foreign. I drove way work told don't sell American-made tires. I'm sorry, get one star that. I ended buying American tires price elsewhere. Took forever get work location traffic horrendous here.
This second time coming Discount Tire Center. I knew I would soon need new back tires. I pulled in, checked tires, said mine would pass inspection make least summer (June I went). I appreciate try sell tires I didn't yet need them. I definitely return Discount Tire Center time get new tires.
Everytime I eat location I end sick stomach. I don't problem Arby's. The dining area clean everything else seems ok I always get sick stomach. Maybe relook food prep.
My beef raw I put microwave two minutes. It even slightly cold I reheated it. The manager says cook medium rare, I explained rare ate lettuce sandwich! Neither brown sugar bacon beef BLT much bacon. (How I post pictures?) For sandwich advertised delicious bacon, fell WAY short. The little bit bacon burnt. Really Arby's? I told manager I idea thought sending sandwich like acceptable. Overall, made horrible day worse. I celebrating two oldest girls' graduation high school, supposed nice dinner disaster. We went Arby's back I least little something eat. That equally disastrous. At least fries okay, albeit little soft mushy reason. Based experience, I would go back. Based experience, I would definitely recommend others.
This store sucks beyond belief! Even though I live within walking distance store, I prefer go Giant Eagle Camp Horne Shop n Save Perry Highway, I don't lot time, I choice come here. First off, rarely everything I'm looking stock do, make sure check dates. I've gotten month-old expired milk don't even get started moldy Yoplait. Second all, important, service terrible. The employees act like forced work here, using card, prepared slide least three four times since employees incompetent eat anything right first time. My advice employees: If hate much, quit get real job. You're favors staying here. This store par everything else Bellevue, isn't saying much.
I cannot imagine miserable place shop jam-packed monstrosity. This store makes thankful Goodwill The Salvation Army resale stores. The customers staff miserable Red White Blue. The clothes priced far higher shops. Merchandise refundable exchangeable, fitting rooms! One purchases clothes risk! What person would buy suit conditions, hoping pants fit? Unlike stores, senior discount credit cards accepted, rare cash business. To reviewer boasts everything 50% every day, sale? It bogus pricing. Red White Blue, uggh!
Pittsburgh store worst thrift store I've ever shopped.OVERPRICED!!!! Very high prices. Backwards policy accepting cash only. Nasty! Don't waste time money!!! THere much better places shop thrift Pittsburgh!
I never treated terrible whole life. Here's rant, friend I stopped one day high school. I senior catholic private school time I required wear fancy uniform I looked highly presentable. I picked shirt I thinking getting held browsed store. They announced closing I across store I got shirt. Deciding get it, I placed near shelf. My friend checked out, walking store woman worked said "where shirt holding". I told I placed self back, said sorry putting back. She said " I walked back didn't see it, it" clearly implied stole it. I told shelf nice I could told didn't believe told go back get else going search me. Now I get doesn't matter shirt 50 cents stealing still wrong I didn't steal told I feel Im justified furious I publicly humiliated falsely accused 50 cents. I walked back store picked started walking back lady said grossly rude tone " well I didn't see back there" apology, nothing. I handed walked out. I've never since. I angry I forgot get name tag I could complain manager. I never treated badly anyone let alone complete stranger store clerk. I don't shop stores hire terrible staff.
If go there, careful prices. Some goods expensive. It isn't worth buying them.
This go-to thrift store family. We've managed find everything need cast iron skillets Yankee candle clothes whole family. The reason I giving four stars sometimes prices little high, especially aren't sale white board front.
I always see place, Saturday decided stop lunch. The atmosphere pleasant. My boyfriend buffalo chicken sandwich, loved. I however, ordered steak cheese pita extremely disappointed. The pita soft fresh steak terrible. It steak-um like saturated grease. When I picked sandwich grease poured it. I'm one send back food, that's fault, waitress came I eating, heard upset food, looked continued way. Needless say I don't think I returning.
I stopped way home whole foods market. They paved parking lot fit 3 max cars time. It big one I normally shop Penn Hills. They beer distributor way hugger selection. But serve penn hills go figure. I looking gluten free beer four kinds including cider. The prices crazy expensive. $35 24 pack cider. NO way!! I buy though cause sunday 4:30 stores close 5 choice. I waited drove way get I buy i'm there. Aside money issue place ok me.
Not fan. I've twice past six months times person working rude unfriendly. It might worker times. Tonight, walked went counter beer. The guy looked us second continued whatever behind glass. I'm sure what. We acknowledged waited more. We finally ask could pay beer. He looked said "Ummm, yeahhh" finally came over, apology, greeting. As soon paid slid glass door closed again. No "thank you" "have good day". There still two hours closed, it's like came trying close. We left wondering happened. It weird experience. I'll continue look different distributor, sucks it's close me, I'd rather spend money somewhere else. I gave two stars instead one good selection cases beer want six-pack.
I unfortunate experience groomer. My dog groomed specifications; infact butchered. I went trouble taking photo dog haircut I wanted, well speaking woman assured would grooming dog. The owner groomed dog, woman I spoke looked nothing like dog I picked up. The owner rude even apologize horrible service. Do take dog groomed!
Pino's appears fashion something nouveau-Italian, smart casual neighborhood restaurant, it's literally that. Translation: menu uninspired predictable. A relatively encompassing selection appetizers entrees revealed quite soul-crushing, certainly lackadaisical attitude toward ingredients, recipes presentation, though service refreshingly excellent. Unfortunately, reason you'd dining Point Breeze would enjoy amazing Point Brugge Cafe street. As previous reviewer mentioned, I stopped simply Brugge full, I unfortunately won't making mistake again.
This place dump. Being new Pittsburgh bought bunch Groupons try new places town. We decided check Park House bite eat drinks. What joke. Even though Groupon included menu items, don't kitchen. They microwave bar food choices microwave. Gross, it's dirty, sketchy bar corner East Ohio Cedar. Never ... They keep Groupon. Maybe use money buy real food.
Unfortunately, I impressed Bernie's. It's shame it's real photography store city, could definitley better. As part black white photography class, I needed pick film photo paper, among things. While Bernie's everything I needed (and lots supplies) I didn't feel appreciated coming in. I spent couple hundred bucks felt like I shuffled door quickly possible. I give one guy counter credit woman right asked get roll two film developed barely hour. I could tell wanted get quickly, still felt like I hassling guy there. I hate see real camera stores shut down, unless I'm pinch I'm probably going order supplies online on.
I developed 120 film day, charged extra 4 dollars roll reason. On website say $8 charged $12. The owner pretentious rude. When I told says 8 dollars online didn't care all. When I dropped film high school kid didn't even tell price "it much calculate" Also, photo equipment, darkroom equipment film way priced. I never going back place. I strongly urge everyone never enter deal Bernie's Photo. Rather, use websites companies like B&H, Adorama, Calumet. The MUCH better customer service better prices. Very disappointed photo store city.
Went buy cold shoe adapter pinch way shoot. He charged $20 exact item sells $6.29 B&H. I bought without thinking, I stressing way gig, furious I thought car. Unfortunately, game town. Makes glad I live New York City. You would think store dying industry would thrive provide better customer service, pretty much reason I would go small store rather big one. They don't even offer that.
I must eating another Max's pararell universe! Food terriable, service worse! Went got Sushi!
Great atmosphere neighborhood pub, good German beer selection, food less mediocre. Won't back. Weisswurst bland. Sauerbraten dry tasteless. Spaetzle was, well, tradidional German Spaetzle. Schnitzel purple cabbage high points, again, it's hard screw fried veal cutlet.
I took boyfriend, German-food enthusiast, Max's Allegheny Tavern last night. We looking forward night together while. I think food good, it's hard say, I could focus LOUD -- I mean LOUD -- woman seated behind boyfriend me. Her profanity-laden discussion dining partners bad first time life, I turned around asked fellow restaurant patron take volume notches. The restaurant almost empty; I idea host chose seat loud party five next couple quiet dinner.
I highly disappointed. I heard rave reviews food near good made be. I got yagersnitzel. While sauce excellent, veal hard cut knife. It also pounded evenly raw thick end. The spatzel soggy, mushy drained properly. It swimming water. The rolls must refrigerated ice cold. The relish apple butter great however. I also say German potato salad dynamite. We also ordered spicy bloody mary given tasted like watered bloody mary mix vodka nothing else it. It bad...the can't drink kind bad. We spice Worcestershire Tabasco plus add salt pepper get taste OK. I note servers excellent. I complaints service! My husband eaten sorely disappointed well. I don't know bad day, I'd weary spending another $75 lunch 3 people getting sub par food bar can't pull basic drink. I hate say, buy I got better German food Hofbrahaus (sp?)
My husband I restaurant many times past 20 years went sandwiches tonight. Sorry say worst food ever eaten place. Reuben sandwich greasy little meat. Sweet potato fries edible. We ate table bar told Andy bartender got zero satisfaction. Since we've bad experience effort restaurant remedy BAD MEAL, warned!
What disappointment!! Evening started pretty badly get much better. We reservations 5 people 7PM past Saturday. Two us early rudely treated hostess. She vague seating us decided wait bar. When rest group arrived (on time!!), I informed hostess looked blankly packed restaurant. She told would awhile. Huh? When asked "awhile" was, said 20min. But seated us 5 (she bus table I take one things dislikes job - people). Food let down. Potato latkes greasy blah. Fish tacos recommended basically fried fish sticks. Pumpkin risotta heavy confusing flavor wise. Others sentiments. Service rough. Long waits lack attentiveness. Noise level (couldn't converse all) made night bit harer tolerate. Not sure Pino's get repeat visit. Disappointment:(
Nice atmosphere average food. This restaurant lot potential. The wait staff far average: They slow, ask multiple times things. They polite wait staff, waitress either little demeaning socially awkward.
Small portions. Over priced food. Very small menu (dinner). Was OK, disappointing overall.
I went Pino's three friends Restaurant Week underwhelmed completely disappointed. We chose option course limited Restaurant Week menu. I selected baked eggplant caprese appetizer, Lazy Man lasagna Florentine panna cotta dessert. Baked eggplant caprese: breaded eggplant soggy mess. Lazy Man Lasagna Florentine: essentially two huge lasagna noodles sandwiching huge clumps spinach (I'm talking like 3-inch high pile clumped spinach) mushrooms peppered in. The spinach ratio control I honestly ate bites couldn't even continue. Panna cotta: decent items ordered. My friend ordered regular menu, advised since food would come different time?? Why? We tried friend's appetizer Italian Fries, described menu sounding similar amazing fries Point Brugge...but bowl regular French fries, lackluster misleading. She also got house soup chickpeas looked like Spaghetti-o's tasted even worse. I don't know positive reviews coming from. There one thing ate impressive way. All overpriced mediocre. I wasted money, I never, ever go back there.
Very disappointing meal. After waiting half hour, meal arrived told friend's meal would coming minutes. Very awkward.t. Salad average best. The beets tasted like canned beets chicken covered blackish oil burnt oil pan. Then, make matters worse chef came argue patron returned food. The chef came humiliate customer explaining returned steak great enjoying it. Eating food customers plate real turn-off....what else cooking? To make matters worse, paying bill, chef change $100 bill customer returned steak.. It uncomfortable watching elderly customer young friend deal situation. He kept loudly requesting credit card women one. Another customer provided change chef crumbled check. I think I would left paid....give lady great dealing lunatic. Long story short....if want eat average food watch chef loose it....this place!
If don't like food... send back kitchen... The "Chef" come scream you... Stay away place.
I going Pino's several years family I feel well qualified give balanced review rather basing single experience, good bad. Every restaurant bad day. And even worst places please customers every then. What get Pino's great service excellent food. If idea Italian Olive Garden, education treat. This real deal. We family picky eaters including full blown celiac love it. Yes, years I twice seen owner/chef Joe unhappy unhappy customers. In one case customer arrogant offensive. On occasion, Joe swallowed pride avoid coordinated revenge reviews followed.
Probably one worst places I recently. I pasta come freezer better prepared. $70 mushy rigatoni chicken dish 2 glasses wine (incl 20% gratuity.) service poor - table 5 server couldn't remember anyone drinks dinner ever. You need write something pad like woman blue del sol/cab sauv help you, that's fine don't come back clueless like never heard us order. I won't going back. Seating also poor, I reservations walked large party, seated me. Meaning I arrived hostess station first, took party behind asking name. I first, last, arrive party reservation name.
My husband I love going comedy shows seen pretty good acts Improv. Ticket prices aren't bad either. I particular I sit, person seats willing let sit choose, especially it's Thursday Sunday night, since aren't particularly busy nights. I one bad experience, I'm giving review 3 stars instead 4 (it takes one poor experience, people!). My husband I went see one favorite comedians Thursday night. There two-item minimum, decided would eat dinner show. Well, mistaken. First all, waitress rude slow. After sitting 5 6 minutes without service finally comes asks want. We order drink food, tells us kitchen caught fire earlier day salads desserts. I annoyed even asked wanted instead starting important fact. At rate, I order Caesar salad beer. It comes it's iceburg lettuce shredded cheese, tomatoes, veggies. In words, regular salad. I inform waitress seemed totally confused. I suppose understand difference, odd. Overall, I felt apology fact couldn't eat, let alone everyone else place. Salad dessert aren't greatest choices expecting eat dinner show. I think Improv waived two-item minimum occasions, even cost money. Afterwards, I emailed Improv concerns. Never. Heard. Back. That said, I likely return Improv....but service. Because it's great place see comedy shows isn't expensive. Customer service terrible.
Had bad experience auto-shop. My car's engine stalls idle coolant temperature right. When make turns, noise front wheel. This garage took week diagnose car gave ~1900$ bill repair lot un-related stuff. And didn't even check cooling system I ask do. Then insisted nothing wrong cooling system loose clamp, loose all. And claim car's problems fixed. They took another week finish job next morning I got car, engine stalls twice within 20 minutes, coolant temperature still wrong front wheel noise still there. Sent car back said another 500$ replace several sensors fix problems, non-sense. I never trust anymore nether you. They trick repairs don't need never fix real problem.
Definitely overpriced offered. Took car check AC, didn't get back whole day, decided fix whatever problem without asking charging insane (approximately $150 places). Definitely go back again.
I agree one poor examples Giant Eagle has. Granted, basics need, 1 biggest city itself. Finding things takes work. My big gripe one weirdest illogical layouts I've seen. It actually takes time find need compared stores times, easily find everything. Parts store diagonal causes go every direction possible. Here quick summary setup classified maze: 1.) When enter store slow wide door, go left walk past front registers produce. Normal enough. 2.) From produce front (a quasi L-shaped department), take quick left go diagonally right walk past pharmacy. Take hard right aisle 1 hit bakery. 3.) From bakery, walk along long meat wall. Diagonally left, you'll find service meat/seafood counters. And wall goes diagonal left, sign Aisle 9 facing diagonally right don't miss 1 side longer towards back other. (Aisles 9-14 almost twice long 1-8). 4.) From meat, frozen straight back long back wall cove. A hard right (if bypass frozen) brings last hot foods, deli, facing front you, Customer Service desk tucked away corner (not really visible walk store). 5.) Once pass deli customer service, take hard right, left (almost U-turn) checkouts, take hard left leave. Most Giant Eagle stores much logical aisles deparment locations set up. You're going every way try find things. Also, service isn't great one reviews said. Given that, I would take Market District Centre Ave GE Murray Ave store. However, remember Giant Eagle Centre Ave N. Craig St, nothing beats BAD store was. There reason store nicknamed "the dirty bird." Compared North Oakland store closed several years ago, Shakespeare St GE light years ahead.
I cannot life understand Giant Eagle, Giant Eagles, would get five star rating. From moment walk it's like someone hit head hard walk around confused state rest time you're there. The set ridiculous. I mean, wants walk around freezer section go smaller usual end aisle see, SURPRISE, meat section hidden area could knocked wall didn't little dance get it. Aisles seem extra long store, tell worked space had. It's like half way aisle realize it's late turn around it's distance end beginning aisle, kind want give sit floor feel like you've walking forever. Honestly, I went I Target didn't want venture complete shopping.
I prefer store Market District Centre. It's overpriced poorly laid maybe bit grimy, carries less products sift need grab simple things, hopefully produce. Parking easy hit unpretentious Wine Spirits stop. I think plaza still exists prevent impoverished people venturing newer fancier stores mere half mile away designed appeal people think cultured discerning.
Been yelled customers (today instance)...place super ghetto...avoid cost. Today, left full cart bacause woman (with baby stoller) shouted "cutting line". Will never go back. At night nightmare.
So...we got seated 635pm. Orders placed. Drinks served. Now 752pm. One party still received chicken sandwich. I My shrimp diablo. It described. Spicy good!!! But hour plus chicken sandwich unacceptable. We also sent order chicken fingers back...dryer sand. And fiancés chicken Caesar salad chicken dry chicken fingers. Barely edible, fact, didn't eat 3 pieces it. Upgrade food service place would somewhat lil better.
The food I give three stars. Burger processed 1/2 raw, loaded fries random cheese. Comedy depends see.
We've improv comedy club twice shows amazing; even opening acts! The downfall two drink minimum, I understand, prices make ridiculous. We stuck beer knew wouldn't watered down. Our waitress horrible. We opportunity order second drinks waitresses bringing checks. If waitress attentive, club could made money us. Oh well. I would recommend eating restaurant show food menu limited overpriced. The thing I'm fan seating. We fortunate enough get early back booth. The last people arrived got turned around seats front us. I feel club invest long, thin tables like bars everyone surface put food drinks. Overall, love comedians we'll definitely back.
The Waterfront Homestead insane, saves trip driving way Ross Park Mall. Anyway, Giant Eagle enormous, you'd imagine. It's still standard Giant Eagle, aka best grocery store ever.
I like Giant Eagle. They organic section they're currently(Feb 2011) process remodeling too, annoying (now) exciting (for future). PROS: Always seems decent parking available; They cute little double-tier carts; Organics section; Wine Vending Machine (that's freaking awesome--Yay, Pennsylvania!); Lots Self-Check-Out lanes; CONS: Sometimes staff bit cranky (but occur anywhere, guess);
Waterfront Geagle primary market. Now they've expanded reorganized, I rarely even set foot Target anymore. Yippie! There's wine kiosk (suck PA liquor laws), buy crazy expensive 6 packs, cheese market, bakery, salad hot bar, butcher, florist, dry cleaners, international foods, pharmacy, little cosmetics/beauty/bath area. They usually sufficient number lanes open, doesn't get nearly crowded Market District. I wish bulk spice selection included part expansion, can't always get want, I suppose.
This place amazing selection comes things zero selection comes others. We popped couple times weekend I spent PIT times didn't really looking for. Visit #1: Liquid smoke. Visit #2: Hawaiian rolls. I know items must exist PA @G-Eagle. They however crazy selection came things like....corned beef brisket anything potato it. My californian mind boggled variety brands cuts corned beef available. Too bad wasn't I for.
Let preface saying, I generally compare grocery stores Publix, maybe even Kroger. That said, one thing Giant Eagle (GE) going quality selection items. There question everything could want. That's praise ends. Let's numerically... 1. Prices outrageous. If walk 100 yards Target next it, you'll find items 30-40% cheaper. A bag Gevalia coffee $7.99 GE, coffee Target $4.99. And it's coffee, Target. Giant Eagle little grocer competition Pittsburgh. This case, you're near Aldi's, Target Walmart, go GE stuff. They're banking lack competition. 2. Parking lots thrashed every day, time. Now, maybe don't care. But I go morning, they've open maybe 30 minutes shopping carts littering parking lot sidewalk front building. They clearly don't bring end night. They also rarely small baskets near door, you'll need hunt one. It's laziness lack care, accounts. They don't care appearance outside, convenience customers. 3. I don't normally mind self-checkout, I limited number items. If I need full grocery order, I'm going wait line one two cashiers working registers, Saturday. The lack customer service regard atrocious. I'm already paying exorbitant prices, I also ring bag cart full groceries too? Walmart doesn't even make that! So that's it. If don't mind paying much higher average grocery prices, ringing bagging cart full groceries generally afterthought customer, Giant Eagle Waterfront awesome!
This review specifically DFS cleaners Giant Eagle location. I dropped clothing sake convenience (I really known better). Never again. My items came back completely covered lint. I could let slide, however pencil skirt safety pinned hanger. The weight skirt caused even larger holes placed pins. Being it's pencil skirt designed blouse tucked in, there's way I wear again. This expensive skirt, completely ruined. Very disappointed. Again, review dry cleaners. The rest store actually better lot GE's I've Pittsburgh. Just don't take dry cleaning here.
I've stopped times (most recently tonight) pick random groceries. This store located next one bike trails I frequent, hence convenience despite fairly far apt. On positive side, I appreciate size store selection products. In terms size, it's larger Shadyside Market District (my normal grocery store, hence standard comparison), I'd say product selection similar. Unlike MD, I've visited, aisles seemed fairly empty customers, may due times visits (usually 7-8pm), well size store. Because it's Market District, prices bit less expensive, nice. On negative side, checkout always seems take forever due slow customers and/or employees, despite I've purchased couple items time. The "express" lanes move speed molasses, self-checkouts even worse. Speaking which, store *way* many self-checkout lanes (about third lanes), non-express ones belts unintuitive. Prior tonight, I would awarded store rating 4 perhaps even 4.5. However, checkout tonight even PITA usually is. None normal express checkout lanes staffed cashiers, despite I saw least one employee loafing around talking another. So, I forced use one many self-checkout lanes. Normally, I don't mind this, esp. I'm purchasing couple items, empty self-checkout lane I spotted one conveyor belt, I couldn't figure use (not mattered, since I one item, self-checkout lanes must operated using specific procedure--see below). So, I moved one express self checkout lanes (similar Shadyside MD), I knew operate. However, I still managed bungle process since I forgot scan one item *before* I put scale doubles bagging station, I wait one ever-so-slow employees come key authorization code I could pay. I'm sure self-checkout stands GE uses standard industry, since I've never used anywhere else, I *hate* whole weighing/bagging process. In order use self-checkout stations, item must scanned placed scale, weight isn't correct reason (including using bag), employee summoned check it. I assume intention prevent people shoplifting, (1) it's major PITA customers employees; (2) employees (including one I dealt tonight) don't care, key code without even looking error message explaining summoned; (3) I doubt shoplifters pay items they're pilfering--they likely stuff purse, clothes, etc. walk out! /rant 3.5 stars.
Just every need. With great hours, solid hot bar, sushi (if you're that), dry cleaning service, pharmacy, tons produce, bakery butchers counter can't go wrong. Two things drive crazy always needing use perks card self check lack hand carts front. I always walk lane hunt basket double back, super annoying. That said small, easily repairable (hint) issue shouldn't keep visiting.
This review Pharmacy. After screw third time I felt others know pharmacy avoid. The first time misread prescription gave wrong dose Synthroid, 1/10th I needed. I ended sick 2 weeks taking little I half dead problem caught. Their response I told say "oops" "it won't happen again". Not even sorry, never happen b/c I went Costco that. This latest time classic. I came simple scrip. Costco closed I went Giant Eagle. After 45 minutes finally inform can't fill b/c scrip isn't specific enough (it common antibiotic, nothing complicated). They didn't bother call earlier tell sooner, made wait wait wait I pitched fit tell couldn't fill it. It late I went Rite Aid Sq. Hill exact scrip ZERO issues filling quickly. WTF? How easy peasy Rite Aid Giant Eagle can't even muster effort tell incompetent fill out? I wonder even legit pharmacist working all. It seems like aren't even staffing pharmacy trained techs, random people street. Don't waste time, risk health. Go pharmacy town, avoid Giant Eagle.
Person taking orders rude I called back problem. Then I told I deal it. After so.e back forth finally agreed give another dish still I ordered. This place ok food bad customer service. Don't go order.
I've coming hear regularly since I moved dormont last year haven't seen issues rough crowd reviews spoken of. I've always great service drinks cheep. Especially pens game pitchers.
TERRIBLE. Keep mind entire experience took less five minutes... I recently consultation Dr. Karnavas new retainer. My mouth small bite tight, I unable use standard impression trays molds made teeth. (I know visiting King Orthodontics earlier year luck even smallest/pediatric trays.) Therefore, I went Karnavas' office, I purchased bunch foam fluoride trays dentists use JUST TRY. I understood might work, I figured harm trying. Apparently, Karnavas DOES NOT POSSESS THE ABILITY TO TRY help patients NOR DOES SHE POSSESS ANY PROBLEM-SOLVING SKILLS WHATSOEVER. Upon entering exam room, I explained Karnavas situation, and, even seeing foam trays, immediately told wouldn't work shallow. A valid point maybe LOOKED AT THE TRAYS LOOKED IN MY MOUTH all. Oh, I forget mention DID NOT ONCE ASK TO EXAMINE MY TEETH? NOT ONCE expresses ANY interest examining mouth, SHOCKING since King Orthodontics done full consult included exam, photos, X-rays, etc. (BTW, people King fantastic; I didn't foam trays back I saw them.) Repeatedly I tried explain conventional impression trays wouldn't fit small mouth asked could please TRY foam tray? No. SHE REFUSED. I asked suggested I do, told "up me." "Up me" except repeatedly negated idea I wanted try. WHAT KIND OF PROFESSIONAL leaves diagnosis problem-solving PATIENT?! A COMPLETELY CLUELESS ONE, that's kind. I even asked see smallest impression tray, skirted around well I never get see equipment. Finally I became exasperated I told didn't make sense waste supplies time (because CLEARLY I WAS WASTING HER TIME) trying something that's proven work. She simply said "OK" walked room. One final thing I thought really odd extremely uninviting: Karnavas kept mask entire meeting. Meaning, I NEVER saw full face. She entered room, I introduced (SHE DID NOT INTRODUCE HERSELF), talking me. STRANGE, considering (again) SHE NEVER EXAMINED MY MOUTH. So, recap: - Lacks problem-solving skills ability try - Clueless - Lazy - Extremely impersonal uninviting Or maybe I'm wrong. Maybe she's disinterested helping 30-year-old women wheelchairs offer pay pocket.
It's unfortunate really try like place let's down. This place way work I'm sucker cheap sweets naturally I'm supposed love place. Now I've gotten good thing bad good. For I stopping every often work sweet pick ups. The older lady's pretty crappy aren't purchasing bulk (for parties) like waste valuable time. Time spent what? I ask becAuse 90% ok I'd get tasted old, stale left out. So longgg time I boycotted place last time I went nothing good lady terribly rude. Today tired old song dance places grub work I remember I bruggers bagels cream cheese work. But low behold I bagleless. So I decided it's bagel, bad could mess up? The answer, bad! Definitely day two old. If isn't I'm shocked falls apart I'm cutting tastes like old bread. It's cheap that's reason terrible. All all. Shoulda stuck guns left boycotted. I'm gracing tl 2 stars younger lady's work nice pumpernickel breads pretty darn good. Only par.
Like frozen cake? How horrible customer service? If Potomac horrible place next event... Long time customer disappointed say buy again. Bought specialty cake pick-up weekend 3yr. old son's birthday. Went cut cake birthday party frozen middle. I called let know told would manager call Monday nothing could day since didn't cakes unfrozen. Not end world I thought would eat cake next day. Then 15 minutes later received phone call back Potomac telling I return uneaten portions cake get partial refund- I floored. They messed cake ready yet I return cake PARTIAL refund wasn't eaten??? Absolutely horrible way treat customer ones error. I explained I disagreed policy making effort correct situation sending cake wasn't ready, explained policy willing work me. I expected call Monday management apologizing staff handling situation incorrectly never called. Apparently feel frozen cakes acceptable events. Sad part I always loved cakes pastries based views towards customers NOT going back. Thanks disappointment son!
I've stopped total 4 times bakery attending business area. I usually opt brownie bites- moist pieces brownie chocolate frosting 0.50/piece get quarters street parking meter. I've tried cupcakes donuts, nothing stood me. Their donuts usually discounted end day. Service hit-or-miss. They accept CC.
This place worst motel I ever stayed. Do NOT stay here!!!!
This worst hotel I ever stayed in. hubby I took smoking room stunk sooo bad I wanted throw up. I afraid sleep nasty bed. morning 5am I wanted leave room cuz smell sooo gross woke up! I felt dirty I took two showers AT Other HOTEL. I never thought I nightmares bcz bad stinky hotel.
I've never Pittsburgh I planned heavy partying needed place crash floor I booked hotel day I drove up. I saw reviews & ignored I figured I'd drunk happy enough dive bed. I checked around 2am, girl checked barely said anything besides "initial sign room there". The room smelt like hot dogs, AC wasn't working I dripping sweat night, none lamps worked all, holes pillow cases bedding, tiny blood stain sheet, I went continental breakfast 9:30am (it ends 10am) already stopped serving, shower ice cold. I checked bed bugs realizing shithole I spent night last night (coast clear). I checked went back Baltimore, seems like heaven earth compared Shittsburgh.
BED BUGS!!! Horrible place! DO NOT STAY HERE!! Stayed wedding attended. Woke middle night bites legs, arms, back. We flip pillow was. BED BUGS. We cut trip short. The man front desk apologized gave us managers name number told us call back later morning. We calling since 8/10 yet receive call back. Such disrespect. We risk bringing back bed bugs spending hundreds extermination fees decency call back.
What dump! I booked room one night place stay Pirates game. It's dirty weird. Our room big it's fills furniture salvaged garage sales. The free breakfast bad gets. (Old cereal bread.) The bed hard best part. A rhythmic thumb, thumb, thumb woke 7:30. The whole room shook. I'll called front desk said somebody running exercise room. This exactly 45 minute. (Impressive cardiovascular stamina) What else...the pool green house, everything dirty, weird quartet sitting lobby 1:00 AM talking...?
I've stayed Day's Inn hotels before, first rather unpleasant experience them. I arrived late night & I checked room, hot air blasting. I lowered temp, took 30 minutes heating/cooling unit make temp adjustment. In meantime, I returned car retrieve rest luggage. When I returned, room cooler, I able smell powerfully moldy smell I've ever experienced hotel ever. I completely exhausted long drive passed out. In morning, I woke horribly scratchy sore throat swollen lymph nodes. Plus "non-smoking" room obviously smokers pets previously. I moved another room following morning, much better, overall feel hotel rather low class & skanky.
We stayed business. I wish booked somewhere else. The staff incredibly rude, lazy completely incapable caring customer service.
Never go fire extinguisher glass broken appear clean someone could cut two outlets room work breakfast cereal want toast don't bother toaster broken
From reading reviews dining guides, looks like much hit miss place. Either love pizza toppings thrown cooking, don't. I fall later category: I didn't like all. I ordered slice cheese pizza grilled chicken salad. For pizza, crust salvageable I pushed aside good quantity cheese (most it). The salad was...nothing short horrific. Overloaded fries (big surprise) cheese, getting lettuce toppings took digging. Eventually, I found bland tomatoes shredded iceberg lettuce hidden far below. I don't get place.
Sorry, pizza cold. All nine cuts it. And garlic wings didn't taste like garlic. Maybe night?
This bad pizza. For money I expect toppings cooked pizza. The cheese pepparoni added crust came out. Also mushrooms can. Do waste money here.
Blah blah blah, cold toppings, piled high cheese, yinzer childhoods, etc. Beto's gets three stars inconsistent - admit it. I've pizza outright bad, I've also pizza nudged time top pizzas list. Usually cycle I really good slice, convince I go back - sometimes week. Then I'll bad slice forget months, maybe even years. Then I'll area cycle continue. The cold cheese doesn't bug get much (portion size far beyond ample. $1.25 slice - 4 well beyond maximum - gets 1/3 bag mozzarella, extra $.50 get much whatever topping feel like having). If get take-out, it'll pretty much melt time get home leave box shut. One thing note - favorite place get black olives pizza, since don't go oven.
Canned green peppers!?! Way much cheese. The yinzers seem like it. The average BMI place probably close 30 wonder; food incredibly unhealthy. The pizza crust tasted like Pizza Hut. Maybe place gets good reviews it's unique twist unhealthy; loads uncooked mozzarella.
Wow, wow. That without doubt worst "pizza" I've ever life. Maybe would like it. Do like toppings can? I didn't even know could get canned green bell peppers. Do like slices pizza covered huge several inch thick mound uncooked mozzarella cheese? If answer yes, maybe place you. It definitely me.
Not like pizza ever had. The crust crispy cheese uncooked. I hated first...but I live it! You might try times. I keep coming back. And price cheap! $1.45 slice? Kidding me?
This "pizza" worst food I ever eaten.
I don't get it. Cold cheese cold pepperoni pizza? Why Pittsburgh weird? I got accustomed fries coleslaw sandwiches guy draw line somewhere. And what's everyone bagging extra cheese taking home? My gut tells would awesome pizza they'd cook it.
They cook pizza pull oven throw cheese toppings cover box. When get home eat hope cheese melts enough eat without pieces cheese falling it. I get definately different tasty. The place clean would expect pizza shop. There two problems I place first one prices. A slice pizza $1.30 I problem seems fair. However want topping $0.50 per topping ridiculous one slice pizza. A small fountain drink (aprox. 16 oz.) $1.99 also expensive. The problem parking lot. Whoever painted lines measure area. I van parked middle parking lot could leave car either front behind left. Don't get wrong pizza good hassle I could without.
It's like fruit cake either love hate it, different I must say. I cold uncooked toppings pizza, sorry I need melted cheese hot toppings please me.
No way. A ton cold shredded cheese thrown top pizza? No no. No beer either.
Been going years, continue...I agree others, either love hate it.. It's different, classic way... Square cut pizza cold toppings... So frigging good...just let cheese melt.....
Worse store freezer pizza. What cold cheese top hot pizza? Terrible. If want quality; Fiori's miles away.
The pizza deserves 5 stars, it's like pizza planet. Nice hot crispy crust cold cheese& toppings thrown last minute serving. Definitely awesome experience, bad... I've steak hoagie cannot straight forward, steak-um(unseasoned) LTO cheese. Just stick pizza. You won't disappointed
Ohio valley square pizza slice...or cut(I know better!) Crispy crust, chunky piping hot tomato sauce, cold cheese....but eat there! Loses appeal cheese melts crust gets soggy. My family eating since ran old building next door! A real craving-type pizza acquired taste. Also family 4 get around $25.
A different style (love hate) pizza. A square cut thicker crust cold shredded cheese top. It's different enough good chance pace standard pie.
I eating Beto's pizza since little girl. Our family would pick 4 cuts carry-out, werent allowed open box cheese melted bit. I make point stop whenever town. There something fresh cheesy goodness, crispy crust, sauce big chunks tomato pepperoni ( even though cooked) makes tastebuds heart sing. Either love it, cant figure it's unlike pizza eaten hate it. To clear, bake pizza sauce comes oven load cheese toppings. The cheese melts bit, entirely. There lot cheese - need order extra cheese! Good subs well.
Didn't live expectations all. Waste time money. Sloooooow service.
Odd.... I'd say it's bad, it's good either. Super sloppy there's far better pizza elsewhere. The dining room atmosphere weird... It's like Sugar Bear took June date cafeteria without fluorescent lights. Plastic forks, plastic knives, paper plates crying kids beer. I'll pass next time.
Either get dont. The cold cheese might sound weird, toppings cold might sound good, shut try it. This pizza unlike you've like pizza must have. I dont make trip Pittsburgh stopping Betos. The toppings plentiful, cheese ridiculous crust super crispy. Love place.
We ended going getting slices carry out. The service good. The cashier friendly even complimented us. The wait time 5 minutes, that. We got 14 slices paid $30.00, pretty pricey. You end paying extra topping slice. I've pizza cold cheese top another close pizza shop, I expecting something similar. I disappointed find toppings uncooked. It wasn't bad, wasn't favorite, like prior pizza shop. Maybe cooked toppings placed cold cheese top? I like slices we're square thick though. I stop back, even wasn't I anticipated!
What's like here?
Over-hyped food, rude service, don't care customers. What happens owner values money "being there" oversee business. I'm local going D's since opened...but doesn't matter more....with exception Eli, bartenders generally rude. Food sub-par...seems busier are, worse food is. What shame. It used "go to" place 'Square, I would take out-of -towners go mountain bike ride Frick. Despite numbers great beers, I can't justify giving money place doesn't care customers.
I thought D's beer mecca Western PA recently discovered House Of A Thousand Beers. The latter bit drive, won't see anything like area. That said, I stopped Ds today must say cave slowly surely going hill. They use countless hard find beers, Ottos, etc. Hardly saw today. And specialty beers costs arm leg, found cheaper elsewhere. For example, $14 12 oz bottle Wulver $25 bottle Angel Share! Whoever actually subjecting outrageous prices literally getting robbed. You find $25 four pack Wulver $10 single Angel Share Giant Eagle.. In fact, find beers cave Giant Eagle much lower price... Shop smart mix match sixer Giant Eagle half price.
Over 200 reviews 100 photos. What I say I've coming 15 years never bad experience. True beer lovers love D's. Oh, dogs ain't bad either.
I love D's! Every Tuesday, group us Pitt come large one-topping $10 pizza night! The waiters waitresses always friendly, I never bad experience here. The beer cave must! They variety beers, something everyone! Once make choice, put one beer coolers make nice cold. You crazy don't like D's!
We come often beer selection spend long cave.
I want like place it's close house, keep disappointing me. First all, veggie dogs greasy don't taste better frozen Morningstar ones buy Giant Eagle. Fries nothing special. And order wrong (either missing topping extra toppings I want) every time I've here. And it's expensive is. Ridiculous pay $40+ four hot dogs soft drinks (no alcohol included). It's also loud restaurant pointless even try talk dining companions. The worst part, though, service. You practically beg waitresses pay attention you. And I don't even mean refilling drink. I mean put order first place, pay bill. Go Franktuary. It's million times better every way.
I went pick wife's bridesmaid dress (she maid honor) boring Wednesday afternoon around 12:30. From outside place looks like bomb shelter dresses window. The show room upstairs, would never know drab, basement-like entrance. As I walked stairs I notices ZERO customers store, however; two employees working sales floor. I stood like jerk bit employees (one owner) kept themselves. The owner respond for, least, 10 minutes even though store empty another employee walking around "dusting" (the store smalls like inside mascot costume). When owner, finally, saw made little annoying noise like "What hell YOU here!!". She walked slowly, like zombie looking fresh brains giving crap I there. She asked follow took downstairs absolutely empty storeroom (by I mean: important couldn't wait customer) took sweet-ass time get dress which, way, second alteration. You see, screwed first time altered dress (even wife tried markings whatever made!). So everyone entitled mistake even business claims perfection; it's important give chance redeem themselves. But, surprise, handed bill second alteration!!!!!! Are kidding me?!!! I argued bit, gave in; I supposed do? We leaving go 200 miles away next day wedding. So I paid. Do go ladies! Oh, think I'm exaggerating, feel free Google company read many reviews make mine look like compliment. If ever needed dress wedding YOUR wedding, reviews scare you!
ATTENTION BRIDES: BEWARE OF THIS LOCATION. My sister soon married bridesmaids purchased dresses shop. Thankfully, early ordering process, mother law noticed sales rep order wrong dresses everyone problem corrected. Now, picking dress realized ordered wrong size! It clearly states size I needed receipt still ordered wrong. The size I ordered required ZERO alterations. When I asked speak owner I told he'd call back. I called every day week still got (sometimes 2 times day). I also town West Coast -working- still made attempts speak owner. At one point employee told speak owner I needed write email. Angrily, I returned inbox full. (I email saved proof). Now, I would absolutely open "mistakes happen" rule chasing owner week getting nowhere- I lost thought. After calling every day week I FURIOUS. I can't say I happiest customers deal I'm sure anyone would reach point panic maid honor - sister's wedding-that less month away dress big!!! I refused bring dress back store I could speak owner ensure going make right. I live 45 minutes hour away didn't want waste time gas! I specifically told every employee. To put icing cake - I spoke owners wife (who claims she's owner you're store), tell country she'd expected deal move on. #WELCOMETOTHEUSAMYDEAR When owner -Scott- FINALLY called week later treated complete disrespect wondered I angry. He barely let talk continuously spoke me. After I decided cut losses made appointment seamstress fix mistake. I hesitant let even touch dress conversation. Candalina brides careless customers. The owner store specifically stated "I'm first (unhappy customer) I'm certainly last..." And I mentioned I'd giving bad reviews said "he'd love free publicity". So here's you're free publicity Mr. Scott.... ********** I would highly advise going shop unless enjoy horrible customer service paying pocket mistakes!!! #enjoythefreepublicityjerk!
I pleased Candalina Bide ordered gown rush arrive time wedding. The downside: alterations expensive poorly done. The hem looked high student learning sew done I make repairs press hem I got home. The alterations bodicve incomplete ended poor fit lots excess materialright across bust. I would order again, definitely take dress professional seamstress.
AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE! Attendant woke wrong side bed! She sooooo rude. Here story: My friend I walked started going upstairs, sign indicates should. A voice downstairs says "I'm here." So turn around start going down. She starts stairs says "no go upstairs." She asked I I told I appointment look wedding dresses. And said "No, KIND dress." A little taken, I calmly told style I liked. She took room dresses said look around. She offer pull (she knows stock, me.) I found one dress I mild interest trying on. She asked I needed help trying on. At point, mood deal her, I said friend would help me. We took dress fitting room noticed dirty tattered. We tried best could (if anyone tried wedding dresses on, know difficult be). As fast got on, fast took booked door. No way I placing responsibility ordering altering dress wedding day shop's hands. They can't even give courtesy trying dresses. All I figure lady zero patience working public. Sheesh!
Worst dry cleaners EVER. Not incredibly poor job clothes, staff particularly nasty rude. The kids work fine, older ladies plain miserable. I would rather spend money someplace else go back hell hole.
I moved neighborhood needed find dry cleaner close by. Regency Cleaners fine dry cleaning entrust tailoring hemming place! I sleeves coat hemmed tailor (or whoever) shitty job (THANKS). The owner (larger woman) rude dismissive questions. I won't coming again.
I live block away. I WILL NEVER EVER take another article place. I had, let emphasize, HAD somewhere I ( I usher cultural district) I dropped pants vest off. They assured would done today. They've week! I walk afternoon I get, "Our machines broke down" second time machines broke down. These people totally incompetent. I wouldn't trust pair socks. What made worse inability tell articles would returned smug'we don't care attitude. DO NOT USE THESE PEOPLE FOR YOUR DRY CLEANING NEEDS!!!!! They ask rate people submit review. Unfortunately zero stars option.
If decided move next door bar, you'd want move next door one. But can't, I already did. And I'm moving.
So random review dentist I blown away nice staff here, easily book appointment finally NICE MODERN office was. If hate dentist like looking trustworthy knowledgable team place!
Yeah, impressed. We ordered fried zucchini start. It's great it's freshly hand battered, seem forgotten something -- FLAVOR. This stuff seasoning all, pour generous helping salt get taste like anything. And $8 that's disappointing. We ordered burgers. At $10 pop I expecting nice juicy burger. What I got dry totally tasteless. The whole burger tasted like nothing. Perhaps salt shaker fell floor rolled fridge something tonight. It accompanied typical frozen steak fries. Again NO SALT OR SEASONING. For $40 night I really shouldn't dump salt everything I order. The service...meh. Our server meek I could barely hear her. Serving takes bit personality, no? When asked happy hour specials were, said "Ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmm....it depends drink." What? What mean? Basically means get random discount whatever order, maybe, perhaps. There list, standard "$5.00 well drinks" anything normal like that. It's basically "order something hope it's happy hour specials." Rather disappointed. They need either lower prices kick notch food service.
Dark, spacious, neighborhood friendly I'd describe Dunnings, fixture Braddock Ave years. I met friend Jean here, week customer. Lucky living Biddle Street, lunches daily different eateries Braddock ave. One day Square Cafe (read review), one day Map Room, another day D's Packs n Dogs. Looking menu, choices limited veggie wrap salads. I chose veggie wrap, sans cheese side apple sauce. The wrap nothing special, mushrooms, spinach, lettuce, tomato, side canned applesauce. Jean buffalo chicken wrap iced tea. She complained tea weak, I never noticed. She said wrap good, chicken breast fried, drenched buffalo chicken sauce, drenched blue cheese dressing wrapped flour tortilla. Dunnings nothing special, it's long time establishment gets regulars. This day, I saw place 9 people bar dinning room. Service ok, waitress seemed preoccupied something someone kitchen took forever bring bill table.
I live Regent Square Dunning.s half-dozen times past several years. It never great restaurant, fact, never even average restaurant. At best, food mediocre, time I would eat I tired get car travel three miles Union Grill Oakland (which offers similar fare Dunning.s - incomparably better job it). Recently, however, things taken nosedive Dunning's. I consider Dunning's single worst restaurant city I've ever misfortune entering. I recently worst restaurant service experience life Dunning's waitress first ignored party, hurried us order, left us sit 20 minutes waiting food empty drinks. We received terrible food (soggy sandwiches, brown lettuce salad, cold french fries - stone cold), complained fries, waitress launched angry tirade (nearly yelling us) wasn't fault, picks food, wasn't anything could it. When I asked speak manager, shook head sadly offered us free desserts. I told I didn't want eat anything came kitchen clearly showed people working simply didn't care - all, didn't want eat anything, even food sitting front us, wanted pay bill leave. He said going "comp" meal. It disastrous experience - single worst restaurant experience life - I never return restaurant new management. It crystal-clear current manager and/or owner isn't job, I cannot understand anyone would choose spend hard-earned money establishment virtually every restaurant town offers far better service food. In short: one - manager, waitresses, cooks - cares customer. Not all.
Average food, slightly average prices quality/taste, average price location, lack-luster service. This place (the location, actual building itself, etc.) could much more. I wish would either step up, sell business someone would let achieve true potential. Until then, dining options Regent Square explored.
Went Wed night. Waited 15 minutes drinks, 40 minutes good. Food average, service bad. Never going back.
I'm sad. Dunning's last day business July 18th. They closing new restaurant moving in. I'm told building renovated new business open fall. Thank staff Dunning's. Your burgers sadly missed.
The drive service leaves something desired. Not order wrong lady grumpy.
This place continues joke. The service bad attitude workers worse. My order never right yet I still go...never again. I officially deem place worst restaurant Pittsburgh.
Worst service. Dirty. Slow. Ignorant strictest definition. Do go here. Bad! Real bad.
The place smells awful. Its non-smoking, reeks stale smoke, I spend 1/2 hour there, I leave smelling like smoke. This isn't isolated incident, really smells every time I've (at least month past couple years). side: decent coffee, decent assorted snacks (pastries, sandwiches, etc.), great location.
This depressing coffee shop. I went wednesday afternoon find place dim, muggy, eerily silent (as music talk, shuffling noises), filled sense sadness. I tried sit enjoy coffee, drinkable, I couldn't get odd atmosphere, music started, quiet I couldn't even tell was, on. I'm giving two stars awesome alternative energy posters hanging far wall.
Inattentive staff. Dirty tables, I agree reviews here. I think "Manager" hires smokers, spend 90% time sitting outside smoking, instead prepared serve customers. I go sometimes it's convenient, b/c location, last week left A/C broken week (in 80+ degree weather). No additional fans, nothing. Then fixed, I went in, ordered coffee order hummus/carrot/celery (prepackaged). Not hummus watery sitting container several days, celery rotting ends, yes brown rotting. I showed kid working there, probably jonesing next cigarette, I asked another one. Without opening I could see least 2-3 servings hummus also watery celery starting rot, like one I given. I asked money back. You know worst thing, though? The kid (he knows nothing customer service let alone food service) put containers watery, rotting celery back case, serve unsuspecting customers! Hello, Allegheny County Health Department?.... Then ultimate insult: 2 kids came selling candy bars. I've seen before, time, I said them: "You know, business, shouldn't here." Well, older 2 girls (probably 11-12 - mother?) put hands hips said smart-ass tone: "We asked da owner, allowed ta here." Well, coffee I spent $2 on? That last money I spend place. Disgusting.
I really want place awesome, because, yet again, I want Regent Square coming area. This place years, I sit drinking bitter, bitter coffee, smelling overwhelming scent (I believe) dog pee, I wonder it's even possible. The three times I've here, I'm greeted I'm colonial space marine trying fish child vent. They always sit corner peeking top counter I terrifying them, duck way. Then grudgingly come I peek around counter them. If I didn't, I'm convinced would sit there, they're certain position hold place, next step even be. This I like call, "The Dance Shitty Customer Service." Today (and I write longingly looking Square Cafe) I decided give chance never crowded, I figured quiet would good thing. The girl counter phone, that's way stayed two minutes I said 'excuse me?'. The charming reply: "Yeah?" She grudgingly got phone, accomplishing Herculean task handing cup, I pumped swill I'm currently drinking. She's currently muttering breath back corner. I'm sure maybe she's bad day, she's asshole, but...if I bet, I'm going asshole. This place pretty expensive coffee awful is, food...Just don't eat food. (side note: place isn't quiet somebody orders something. She stomps around like she's sent room. Then continues muttering) Okay, place travesty. Bad coffee, bad odor, bad lighting, unbelievably bad, grudging service. I would beg owners put effort place. As now, it's cornered market Regent Square, sits like middle finger boastfully pointing people Braddock Avenue.
Ughhhh, Katerbean abusive boyfriend I keep coming back hate it. There nothing else around convenience wins today due snow, extreme exhaustion need caffiene. Why, ask? I asked gal behind counter, kindly, I could borrow pen moment. I got annoyed sigh, eye roll zero eyecontact. Really? I asked pen, kidney. My pleading coffee shop intervention someone, anyone, red alert! Help us RS residents, please!
Yeah, I'm coming anymore. 1) They charge extra whipped cream. 2) They use canned whipped cream. If you're gonna charge whipped cream damn well better make fresh whipped cream. Jeez. 3) My hot chocolate gross. Like use Hershey's chocolate syrup something. Yuck. 4) I saw keep filters prefilled ground coffee sitting counter get stale! WTF? Sigh. I hope people Biddle's Revenge open place soon know WTF doing...
Is possible give zero stars? If so, Katerbean would rate zero. Bad atmosphere, unfriendly employees, slow reluctant service, pump coffee, dingy interior, dirty tables. If telescreens couldn't switched off, place would perfect setting film Orwell's "1984".
Cigarette smoke ashtray smells combined mediocre coffee subpar customer service cup tea, I never even rank tea here. Thank Flying Spaghetti Monster Biddle's Escape opened I absolutely reason go Katerbean.
Sadly, place permanently closed.
THE best cheesesteaks, freshest buns, nothing bad here!!
New town clueless hardware, I picked Master's Hardware Google Maps listed closest store house, likelihood would smaller easier navigate Lowe's Home Depot. Luckily, guess money. My visit Master's Hardware friendly, efficient, informative. Unlike hardware stores, you're left fend yourself, Master's Hardware helps pick everything need non-salesy, unobtrusive way. For nails, wall anchors, lighting pull-chain extensions, little moving needs, Master's trick. Not sure bigger projects, might want call ahead you're planning serious renovations or, I don't know, demolition. If you're clueless like me, place go.
Growing Swissvale, got battleship every football game, birthday party, on.. late 20's mom I still ritual going shop grab battleship dinner separate homes least month. In 20 years I think single bad experience place, long wait I forgive it's totally worth it.
My friends family rave place, I big fan all. Every time I've gotten sub, bread dry crumbly (I like bread fresh), toppings limited. I support small business tho, I'm hungry swissvale/Rankin/Braddock area, I'll pick one share. But otherwise, I'd rather opt sandwich regent square waterfront.
Gonna get cold cuts today! I must say know make quality sub "BattleShip." You come place know quality line stretching door. I saw one guy walking least five. I've ordered parties events always stop (even I'm hungry) I'm Swissvale area. There something subs I can't explain. They everything right here. From breads meats, shredded lettuce battleships legit! They serve 40's too!
Best damn hoagie Pittsburgh, order 5 super destroyers every steeler game, get destroyer won't disappointed!!
We never watch game party without Battleship hoagie!!!! Always crowd favorite!!
The ultimate tailgate essential. Steeler football battleship go hand hand!!
Pizza fine nothing special. The salad I ordered wrong, though. And beware prices: What's website wrong. And manager owner say there's nothing (except charge higher price isn't website).
I've lot pizzeria's Pittsburgh. Every Yinzer place recommend. And every time, I disappointed taste, smell, look same. This place decent pizzeria. You walk order. That's it. No place sit eat. But small shop right. The pizza I tasted, reminded spots Manhattan. I took biye, felt like I back uptown. Its pulling slice off, toppings come right it. That's bad thing, IMO. That means, load pizza. So getting pay for. Look, pizza pizza. And everyone opinion. But Tue swissvale/Braddock/Edgewood area. Go Veltre's Pizza.
This closest grocery store me, I go way avoid it. Finding parking spot horrible stop signs everywhere right front main entrance store. Everything place it's hard make connection product might located store. Mind middle remodel, I may come back make addendum review later date dust settles. As prices go, norm Pittsburgh area. Variety, yeah, got covered. Tidiness, working that.
This store gross I almost sick! Onions peeled half-rotten. Squishy garlic. Dirt everywhere. I NEVER step foot place again.
Security guard confronted door 10:50 pm like I scum idiot shopping near end shift/closing time. He wanted know I going get. I told stuff. He told I 3 minutes get it. I informed I 10 minutes. He told I would store 11. He proceeded follow store. I sought manager seemed think great customer service. I left intended purchases walked without buying. I haven't back since. I professional. I taken tie sleeves rolled 1/4. Made online complaint. No reply.
Review Dress Success dry cleaner. Dropped two suits dress Friday. Was told would ready Sunday. Werent ready Wednesday. Was told memorial day caused delay. Shouldn't mattered supposed done beforehand even done Tuesday minimum. Caused problem even basic stains weren't touched didn't time take elsewhere going wedding. Six days cost 33 dollars. Would 26 thirty cleaners Oakland done day. Just terrible. Just go elsewhere. Not even remotely convenient.
One worst Wendy's I've ever experienced. Every morning 30-minute wait - ordering - food.
Please clean floor properly. It feels like Crisco feet. Very dangerous.
Didn't get items I ordered AND PAID FOR! What's worse is, I wasn't given receipt I can't even prove forgot give something! When I called corporate tell this, said I could go back since I food hand I get missing... receipt (I don't think so) decided give store number instead I inform manager driving there. So gave number BUSY, times get it's dial-up set tones ear piercing! We also didn't get straws, utensils food. Though, wasn't hardly wait I must lucky there, lucky enough good service!
This store absolutely horrid (as majority shopping complex located). It dirty employees lazy exceptionally slow. Most Wal-Mart stores checkout speed twice fast Kmart, really saying something.
Are employees required grumpy here? They look like hate job. The store well stocked prices usually higher competitors.
A couple times month swing dance Edgewood Sundays. Frequently featuring live band, small cover charge (cash only) friendly atmosphere. The level dancers attending hit miss relaxing sunday evening. There area tables, chairs snack table beverages additional donation fee. The parking difficult (it residential area), would smart try get early. I believe also dance lesson beginners dance starts run group called Coal Country Traditions Pittsburgh based group older dancers swing dancing well folk dancing different sorts, always pamphlets dance regards dances events going within city table back dance.
First off, I like family restaurants avoid chains possible. Sometimes that's possible - future I'll avoid one matter what. Its always zoo, servers interested doing, poorly. Food comes order all. The managers don't care. We actually waitress spill soup, catch hand, dump back right front us. Then gave us thinking ask wanted another. Just go anywhere else, can't worse!
Normally one would think, one chain restaurant like rest I nothing problems here. The staff appears constantly changing managers tell something. I've lunch dinner continue issues. Here problems had: co-worker entire glass iced tea dropped nothing comped check; wait long time orders taken; I ordered pick 2 told soup could possibly come first(even though I've done before); argued us meal supposed come point us showing picture; staff appear properly trained.
Worst Applebee's experience I've had. We seated waited 10 minutes even greeted. And flagged someone down. No apologies finally taken care of. I needed ask water three times I finally went bar ask some. It server came water. We ordered soup entrees. He delivered one soup appetizer claiming ordered way misheard. About five minutes later manager came said something lines "I understand you've issues" I proceeded calmly explain issues been. You could tell wasn't interested say didn't seem care server issues. His lack caring apparent fact waiting greeted one many asks water, several servers manager standing behind bar shooting breeze. The food (once order right) good, wait mistakes make highly unlikely never return location.
I told everyone I wasn't feeling this. Should listened gut one. We didn't make reservations party 7, I suppose have. They create space us. Like really create it. Where sitting walkway. Knew I walkway waiter asked us move little girl wheelchair could get around. But I didn't problem that. What I problem nasty flies building. And you're eating too...it's disgusting. The place freakin crowded well...maybe I hate crowded tight spots. As far menu, I wasn't impressed. It took 20 mins find something (partly I'm picky). But I ended chicken broccoli alfredo, nothing rave about. I wanted broccoli provided, oh well. The lime/kiwi lemonade pretty good though.
Another overdone steak utterly inattentive staff! Still sitting waiting someone give care. So, finally got attention server server, Michael. She kind enough take steak back kitchen. Michael, server, finally shows 10 minutes later half-hearted apology let know steak prepared again. He offer refill drink glasses sitting empty 20 minutes. The manager makes appearance brings strip steak looks rare sight it. He informs steak apologizes. He goes away. I cut steak it's, guessed it, Pittsburgh Rare. I asked medium rare. He returns I tell chef needs go back culinary school learn prepare steak. The manager apologizes asks I want take pathetic piece beef home me! Not rare it's cheap cut strip steak loaded connective gristle. I said thanks. He comped husband's meal left. I never hope people lose jobs cook server really need serious retraining! I never go back Applebee's again.
Takeout mess location. In past I've wait 30 minutes past time gave pickup, sit hold 15+ minutes find didn't anyone manning phone. The last time didn't include entree we'd ordered, month later failed send gift card make cost.
With location busy intersection exit Parkway makes almost nightmare use place. Hardly parking don't need actually get gas. The inside store small side well. Doesn't help store part changing BP branded store 7-eleven. I swear decided amazing put ATM four times size before. Be careful trip loose floor tiles well. Not many choices gas Edgewood/Swissvale exit, maybe wait go another location.
They took vegetarian meal menu. They'll make one especially I always feel demanding would prefer kept menu. Plus, one always really quiet. Like, I feel guilty, like I'm troubling staff. And drive apartment's parking lot get there. Very awkward location atmosphere.
It depends chef performing . I twice last several months felt everything average . I seen chefs different restaurants put much better show .
Very disappointing. We love Japanese steak houses least favorite meal Pittsburgh. Nice atmosphere, service fine, dinner average poor. The salad dressing tasteless, jumbo shrimp cooked chewy. It tasted steamed hot grilled. The shrimp sauce thick flavorful. Our chef ( new slow) compulsively wiped knives grill (which dirty sat down) dirty rag? I guess lot depends chef get cooked tasteless meal. The sushi people ordered table looked good. We big circus atmosphere Saga, Wexford location best hibachi food Pittsburgh taste.
This far worst hibachi restaurant I eaten at. The food bland onion soup fried rice (which basically white rice chopped onions) chicken (which pale looked like boiled). Hibachi food typically tons flavor tastes good grill marks char, none food had. I question whether even cooked hibachi table (we ate regular table ordered hibachi menu). Not food bad service terrible. Our waiter didn't even know hibachi dinners come two sauces, acted confused I asked them. Additionally, ordered sushi roll appetizer instead getting dinner, received dinner even though saw sitting sushi bar good 15 minutes beforehand. This restaurant may around long time doesn't even compare hibachi restaurants expensive I've eaten at.
This place crappy veggies u get onions zucchinis took server 30 min serv us drinks took 20 min take orders time chef comes already hour food show ate waiter didnt even recommend anny desserts gave us chek leave saying anny thing els got still eating like wtf im still eating mi family u give check chef left like five min ago . I recamen go sime els n eat
This WORST Hibachi I ever had. We came friends birthday, I never going back. Service mediocre, food real travesty. You go Hibachi show, it's fun cook makes SAME Giant Eagle joke entire time. He also couldn't perform tricks pretty standard Hibachi chefs. The food. Not good. My boyfriend ordered tofu cold middle. He didn't bother guy heat more, b/c would hassle. The chef forgot one friends meal completely got rude server. Then everything cooked, looked asked eat shrimp. I replied "no, never served any." (I ordered chicken shrimp.) He sends server back kitchen get more. By time cooked, everyone finished eating. Come on. To make matters worse, left saw head chef. That doesn't say much rest them. I don't know people keep coming here. There WAY better hibachi Pittsburgh, lot less money. I mean honestly, I paid $9.50 glass Kendall Jackson. No. The best part meal cupcakes friend brought. Do wallet stomach favor go different Hibachi place. Benihana worth time money.
My family I going Benihana 5 years now. We've always wait least half hour seated, even we've reservations. In past forgivable, mostly close home us, food okay (albeit little pricey), Grandmother absolutely loves entertainment hibachi. But changed last night went party 8 mothers birthday. I made reservations two weeks advance birthday dinner. When I called almost totally booked spots left evening. Our reservations 7:30. We arrive little early 7:20 I let hostess know checks us in. Then basically wait wait wait. We notice hostess turning people away, notice two tables seated 30 minutes haven't even gotten soups salads. By nearly 8 O'clock. Then mother overhears hostess telling someone short staffed wait going extremely long. By point we've waiting 45 minutes. My sister takes walk restaurant notices 1 hibachi chef working, SEVEN tables seated, waiting food/drinks. So I ask hostess much longer seated. She informs least another half hour get table, two hibachi chefs two kitchen chefs called sick. It would another hour seated would even start taking food orders. This TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. First all, hostess informed us arrived short staffed would long wait. OR, manager phoned people reservations asked could reschedule. Either way, informed instead letting us stand lobby hour, knowing would another hour half would actually eat, evening reservations. We decided call Ichiban see could accommodate us. They told us could walk right seated immediately. As leaving ran gentleman outside smoking told us party reservations 6:30 still ordered food! It 8:20pm. Our first dinner Ichiban actually turned much better previous dinners Benihana, I don't think we'll ever going back there. I think Ichiban new hibachi restaurant choice.
Seems review filtered I'll share 2 cents again, place sad. Awful service, awful food, lack knowledge smack real Chef's face.
The absolutely WORST hibachi experience I've every life! It granddaughter's 4th birthday thought she'd get kick hibachi chef. Fist wait 45 mins seated. The restaurant wasn't even half full. We chose dinner portion instead lunch time hungry waitress said would get larger portions. She lied. Our hibachi chef absolutely horrible! He spoke softly couldn't hear anything said. He barely spoke didn't put kind show all! Our 4 year old bored wanted leave. The party seated us ordered lunch versions got food! The chef mixed everything together one got larger portion anyone else. The thing got instead half slice zuccini little bit onions. None us even like onions. My "steak" least 1/4 fat chef cut disposed didn't even leave enough small sandwich. By time main course served vegetables rice ice cold. We asked speak manager told us weigh portions back bring cook them. However like I said chicken mixed together least 1/4 steak complete fat thrown out. The manager didn't seem care situation. We paid almost $10 meal extra "dinner" portion. He could easily knocked "lunch" price, refused. After this, heard another chef complaining place new owners everyone quit. I one never, EVER, go back would suggest everyone reads stay away. We feel completely cheated.
Since changes awful. Shortcuts sushi. Quality food same. The staff neglecting. It's sad see great place go downhill due changes management. Very sad.
Extremely disappointed, food absolutely awful. We sat bar ordered there. Benihana special rice tasted like overcooked white rice salt chicken stock poured it. Our vegetables soft, tasted same, mushy. My sushi (Hamachi) 1.5" x .5" piece underbelly still attached also inedible. Our chicken flavorless rubbery. To top server uncaring disinterested. This last trip much better options. It's bad gold standard restaurant longer.
Went friend's birthday worst experience ever. We waited order food received drinks. The waitress wasn't good explaining menu, sat waited least half hour chef arrived -only tell us taking another table we're getting new chef...the chicken chewy undercooked, 2 people table didn't receive ordered. When time checks waitress became standoff - ish us telling us someone needed pay food wasn't received nothing chefs. We requested manager explained chicken undercooked. He actually ate chicken plate told us fine! !!! At end all, waitress didn't even know managers name bashing party. Very unprofessional. I won't eat again, sure advise others
This worst hibachi restaurant Pittsburgh. The service slow food good price charged. The food cold everything flavorless. The salad steak sauce tasted like cleaner. The chicken also extremely dry. Nakama ichiban way better choices Pittsburgh.
This place longer used be. We went LATE Tuesday night said couldn't seat us 30 minutes unless wanted sit bar even though looked though plenty tables open. We sat bar looked menu wanted order sushi anyway. Both drinks sushi astronomical price. Also, didn't much sushi menu all. It really disappointing. We actually left went somewhere else.
My older brother special needs personal dietary restrictions. He lives care home hours away, visited us Pittsburgh little back, I really thought would fun experience Hibachi first time. I read rave reviews accommodating Benihana locations, decided visit Benihana Greentree. My brother excited. It almost 10 pm, called first see still seating. They said yes. The place completely empty. Our waitress lovely. We told wanted try make sure brother closest Hibachi experience could dietary limits. One part brother's disability eats foods every day cannot deviate. I asked could substitute chicken shrimp appetizer (assuming would probably small up-charge). We also asked instead rice noodles, if, steak dinner, could extra vegetables (again, assuming may small up-charge). Our waitress understanding, said check manager first. She came back said manager said couldn't accommodate. I asked see manager. Directly front brother, manager said weren't able accommodate crassly explained "he" "wanted" chicken appetizer instead shrimp, would buy whole chicken dinner "he" "wanted" extra vegetables instead rice noodles, would buy another dinner. I mortified, boyfriend mortified, waitress looked mortified. My brother uncomfortable embarrassed kept staring down. This experience I hoping brother ... gross display disgusting careless discrimination made hurt entire life. He shouldn't put position. In case confusion, I calmly made one last ditch effort privately explain manager brother, avail. I livid. We paid one round drinks, tipped waitress - whose compassion touched heart - left. I admit, I contemplated escalating this. Shame Benihana. If manager still job, I would suggest kind training decent human make others feel like second class citizen may little different you. It's 2016. Get program. ***Also, case you're wondering, brother since back Pittsburgh visit get first Hibachi Saga Robinson. They wonderful, accommodating respectful.
Dirty place horrible service. Disappointed use good it's crappy
I sad report Mad Mex longer making favorite dish: three cheese three pepper enchilada. Or, I told waitress December 28, I lucky enough pass Pittsburgh holidays. Boo hoo. I sad.
Perhaps mistake going Sat.night summer .Who knew would packed gills thirsty college students. Loud understatement. We crammed little table four us elbow elbow diners seated sides. This already put bad mood.I never well Europe sharing table stranger U.S irks even It took forever get drinks simply water soda. We last caught waitresses eye told would take care us guessed.....? What heck waitress took drink order delivering food next us. When Ms.Wiffty finally brought long awaited food totally wrong order.We even considered asking could keep waited long, went leave us another 20 minutes. What got long last disappointing. It tasted better Taco Bell anywhere America.Think nacho grande side Guacamole. First last visit.We notice bill gave us wrong check .It half amount food ordered probably poor guys check.We waved .Her reply leave money table I'll come get later................ So did.
Love spicy black bean dip black bean pineapple quesadilla... mmmm can't get enough black bean.
Not pleasant experience. While looking menu, ordered margarita draft beer. The beer came bottle instead draft margarita terrible funky taste - almost "plastic chemical" taste. Next chose chips dips/salsa. We able choose three dips/salsas server brought one incorrect. To credit, promptly corrected error brought right one. Needless say elected dinner departed drinks chips. There much better Mexican food drink 'burgh.
I don't understand I keep wanting go back here. Maybe large plate food blue corn bread comes Carnitas Enchiladas, preferred dish. Or maybe kiwi margarita happy hour, even though gives heart burn. I always leave place thinking service mediocre, food standard, I probably ordered 2 margaritas. I usually feel stuffed I walk like I pulled stomach. I usually need sit car minutes I drive away due stuffed I feel. I hate feeling stuffed I always order Carnitas Enchiladas never finish it. Also, chimi frozen. I asked could put mushrooms revealed freeze them, claiming needs done deep fry it. Not sure truthful is, chain freezing meals I like restaurant. The noise level place seems high, blasting pop music loud drains tables' conversations makes shout person front you. This often not, yet sometimes loud. They outdoor seating I say I want every time I peak around corner entering reminds outdoor bar party. People standing table fence railing drinks chatting. Not atmosphere I prefer dinner. Some notable mentions black beans spicy, I like kiwi margarita tasty. I give place 3 stars I feel mediocre standard. Plus I always walk away paying I want, think deserve.
I went mad mex dinner Friday night. It noisy I recommend kids. The chicken fajita cooked, dry, charred. Everything overpriced; drinks, entrees, dessert.
This place okay. The waiter horrible barely checked us. The food also good. It bland didn't lot taste it. I coming back.
This afternoon I took 4 year old mad mex lunch great morning swimming yoga class. We send back food chicken stone cold (even though surrounded sizzling veggies skillet). It seemed like yesterday's chicken. They brought fresh food I'm kicking eaten it. The rest day spent cleaning food poisoning accidents bathroom.
This location different feel others around Pittsburgh. Perhaps it's well-lit bar, maybe it's there's new bartender every time I make here. In case, doesn't quite "feel" North Hills Robinson have.
While I LOVE Mad Mex, one avoided. For whatever reason, always seem manage mess orders couple occassions, I've felt well eating there. Because it's BB, I keep thinking I wrong that. But waking middle night sorts unpleasant stomach issues, I've write location off. Go Robinson instead... (Or BB, please, please get new KM location!)
Mad Mex "go to" place eat. It could awesome beer list always includes least couple IPAs. OK, beer bonus, food fantastic. My current favorite "wing-o-rito" burrito stuffed boneless wings choice sauce. I love insane southwest sauce go board changing chicken shrimp. Tonight I used birthday free entrée got steak shrimp burrito. The second half lunch tomorrow!
First all, I say I didn't even realize Mad Mex location South Hills! The location little hidden end shopping center main road. But I'm happy here! I foresee meeting margaritas future since it's close home! My friend I came annual Gobblerito Friendsgiving meal. The Gobblirito good every year. I wish extra side gravy something since get little dry. I'm sure it's new thing year something location, black beans mixed mashed potatoes, I thought little weird. I also got strawberry margarita. I asked frozen, waitress said "frozen thingy down" little disappointing, still good rocks. Service okay. Our waitress took awhile get table food came fast. I'd like come back tho location see normal menu items are.
I like Mad Mex, however predictable non-authentic may be. The portion sizes mammoth I come away satisfied sense regret. Their beer menu happily extensive. Charging $9 chips salsa bit crime, wouldn't ya say though!?! I mean, c'mon! Our service times lacking--a bit rushed inattentive side. Also, require wait staff servestraws/ lemons/etc unless asked cusotmers---weirdness-cut odd cost-cutting, anti-service friendly measures please.
I'm town, I'm surprised disappointed level received quiet Sunday lunch hour. Our waitress gave us indignant responses every request, visible eyerolls things like sharing fajitas. When order came completely wrong, said "Sorry mixup, I don't control kitchen" made effort correct order. Had showed effort contrition, error really wouldn't bothered me, actually seemed act like fault. It really disappointed dad treated like family meal together final day town. Please train staff better treat customers level appreciation helpfulness.
I love love love Mad Mex. The one University City Philly exact moved life okay Mad Mex too. We've times close home time something isn't quite right. The recent time, I'm writing review, food took one hour come. We repeatedly flagged waitress kept insisting "checking it" finally huz let manager walk manager walked apologized order never put in. They took care bill still, left really poor impression terrible incompetence. Our waitress never apologized acted though nothing happened came back see everything was. Extremely disappointed service. I'm giving 3 stars love Mad Mex big azz margaritas Greentree location really needs step up.
Mad Mex awesome. In general I like place, I issue location: TOO DAMN DARK! May seem like small thing, hardly read menu it's problem. Every time I go I end bad mood. Such simple thing fix, too.
Been times now, food mediocre best. Had waitress take order wrong, brought completely different dish. Last time I waitress nice accommodating, ordered chicken quesadilla, chicken super dry. It's hit miss place, mostly miss.
The food okay, worst service EVER. I never felt compelled write yelp review before, bad experience I felt I needed share. We passing town way home pirates game wanted try something new, love mexican went way come mad mex. My boyfriend one robinson twp said really good. It took forever server come, did, acted though needed hurry wanted anything. As took order, I questions ordered I never mad mex, seemed annoyed kept looking away tables told wanted. Slow everything, I felt like inconvenience even ask drink refill. Even brought togo box, payment ready told us would back take it. Like you're table, can't take card you? What hurry? I server I would never say table, I never experienced restaurant before. I get things, server able multitask. My boyfriend kept apologizing suggested going disappointment. I would maybe try different mad mex location, I wouldn't plan go back one.
The food great, service slow compact place. My last two visits I ventured bar twice get beer waiting extended periods table. My wife I ordered beer took 16 minutes arrive! :(
I really hoping place would good food. I disappointed extent. Latin food favorite. I'm always trying checkout new Latin restaurants hopes finding really good food. I ordered 2 ground beef tacos black beans rice. The tacos decent rice beans horrible. Both dry lacked flavor. If come dont order black beans rice.
Horrible service. I mean HORRIBLE. Went non-peak time. Pretty quiet there, lot going on. Three employees sitting around chatting watched disabled, elderly friend stand wait long, endless minutes without anything. I finally went bartender - also hanging chatting watching us stand - ask hostess available. Her response? "Oh, I seat you." Really? Then I ask to!? Then, young male waiter assigned table laughed companion asked restrooms are. WTF? Look, guys, would crummy service anyone, treat elderly person disability like unconscionable. We left won't back.
Have wanted try restaurant time. Finally went Friday night. It loud, expected Friday night. Had 30 minute wait seemed strange least 4-5 tables open. Whatever, two seats bar decided eat there. Ordered Yuengling margarita rocks, salt. Bartender came back quickly looked like watered lemonade. WORST MARGARITA I HAVE EVER BEEN SERVED!!!! What heck? It came can?!?! And supposed good Mexican restaurant? Anyway....ordered seasonal chicken tacos. Described served butternut squash, Brussel sprouts cauliflower. Yum! Served presented nicely. And ICE COLD!!! I mean cold touch. Didn't even get time warmer. OK, SO bartender takes plate, gets new order honestly pretty tasty. Have never fall vegetables chicken taco made interesting flavorful taco. Although I ultimately enjoyed dinner, I did. It drink 1/3 margarita. Glad I tried place won't rush back. Sorry, bummer.
Service mediocre food poor. Burnt chicken burrito. My friends burrito supposed primarily vegetables 100% rice. There mole sauce described dish. The frozen margaritas horrible although regular margaritas decent nothing write home about. There charge chips salsa sitting across bar nothing bar. This explained us ordered. The I think I understand policy. It's bizarre can't sit table bar order food bar charged price. This restaurant really gone downhill last years. And I'll never go again.
Haven't long time service food suck! Waitress nice, polite attentive. Ordered Carnitas Burrito, I wanted rice I would gone Chinese. Struggled find carnitas peppers....seriously 95% rice. That one Worst burritos I ever, ever had. Never Mad Mex South Hills!
Went bar. Waited 10 minutes drink, waitress got order wrong. Not worth trip.
Service really slow. Server great though. Food okay. Don't expect authentic Mexican food here. It's American Mexican spot. I wasn't able try drinks, beer, there's happy hour! 1) We got Mad Mex quesadilla chicken breast vegetables chicken burnt. You see charcoal burn it. 2) fish tacos okay. It came HARD Mexican rice, black beans. I didn't try black beans since I hate beans. 3) I got hot wings San Francisco flavor? And spice level insane. wasn't spicy best dish day. (Didn't take pictures I hungry waiting)
I like shopping here. However, finding want somewhat difficult. The layout clothing improved "juniors misses line don't zig zag. The store doesn't seem get shipments new clothing often, sections bleak. It's like finding needle hay stack. The employees always nice though! And I never wait dressing room.
3 stars time delivered. Right time 30mins. The pizzas warm overall PizzaHut pizzas lost taste. Very bland unappetizing.
favor find another pizza location. I ten minute drive location. order supposed take hour fifteen minutes. half hour late I called manager said called door. I've calls porch day, person showed mailman. manager called back said believed driver lying - courtesy - going rewarm two hour late pizza oven send soon possible.
Can give company zero stars? This place makes feel unwelcome dumb. The staff judgmental assigns tasks solely based reaction you. Aka, assigning us mundane task taking away giving another couple weren't fast enough...We went Valentines day, food tasted OK..and staff leading group HORRIBLE. Not even remotely worth cost treated like imbecile.
A oddly laid supermarket. Deli isle wide, walls closing you, put DIY olive cart front make cluttered. Just poorly laid store showing it's age.
Dirty small. Not laid well. Expired items shelves. Rude cashiers. Self check usually broken. Horrible experience once. I don't shop unless I to.
Store small always crowded. Managers workers rude condescending. Actually awful experience manager named Chris. His attitude toward made feel putoff. It made want leave store after. I witnessed rude condescending customers too. I don't feel though store hired workers good customer service skills, especially manager Chris.
Holy canoli. This strangest giant eagle I've ever seen. The layout totally weird.. Aisles like diagonal there's freezer section right walk in? Check hidden around corner entrance.. Only thing worse parking lot accident waiting happen.
A family owned operated hardware store definition almost ever need. For small percentage convenience I often support Greentree hardware given lack stores big box world days. Even I forgot wallet one day I working car Dennis let take item I needed lieu payment later afternoon next day. Asked length rubber tubing another day 6" I needed given, charge. Long live Greentree Hardware!
I guess around early 2014 I noticed Dennis left greener pastures 20+ years local fixture. All subsequent visits handled increasingly younger staff didn't know crap products selling. Was sad see Dennis go frequenting store decade. Apparently store either closing reset DoItBest corporate, I say? I know I miss Dennis, daughter, attention needs customers.
Obviously, aren't coming way cool, 80's decor. You got kids others whose palette doesn't extend past burgers fries. These limitations overlooked. What can't forgiven, however, shabbiness place. It looks like gets vacuumed week, bathrooms disgusting.
Had beer appetizer, so-so. Service nice quick, I need kids. Kids seemed like kids meals, usual Mac cheese, grilled cheese, chicken fingers. Huge line Mad Mex Friday night, none here. I doubt go back, many choices.
Absolutely horrible service, entered hostess gave audible sigh like inconveniencing presence. We seated 10 minutes never server come even take drink orders. Needless say left, going back.
I wish I could give NO STARS!! Heed warning - I listened/viewed Yelp going... I waited 5 minutes hostess come take name, Sunday, 5:30 eat. This place packed. Why?? While waiting, I used ladies restroom. Let tell you... I've seen cleaner restrooms truck stop. Good gosh - disgusting. There two stalls one disgusting, ladies discussing waiting I in. There paper floors - really?? Doesn't anyone come check this? So I go back get seated. The area around us gross, carpet dirty swept, dirty dishes empty tables, looked un-kept. Our waiter came up, I'll keep name this, looked like woke rolled bed came work. He took drink order left. Came back dropped left again. Like really? menu isn't big! We got pick three menu - comes tortilla soup, burger fries cookie. The soup came quick (the good thing happened) finally got food - I swear took like 30 minutes. I got burger pink middle, waiter asked I wanted burger cooked, would known I wanted done pink. However, NO WAY I sending back. I didn't even eat it. I gave half husband eat. The fries salty. NEVER waiter come ask food ok, - nothing. RUDE! Then comes says "Your cookies right up" - like ok? We don't get choice ones want? I guess not, get cookies - outstanding, always, worth trip. This whole "adventure" took hour half. Others around us didn't waiter seemed better service, I wondering waited us? Either way, I going back find out. How disappointing, recently moved Pittsburgh Virginia took Max Erma's - loved there, couldn't wait go back one - quickly found same....
I live one mile M&E lunch friends many times year -- recently, today! I NEVER disappointed food service. Quite contrary! Food always tasty wait staff always terrific! We always time arrivals bit normal lunch dinner hours (arriving c. 11:30 4:30), never problem seated. Regardless I am, I always try avoid arriving restaurants busy hours OBVIOUS reasons. My disappointment Max n Erma's took chicken salad menu. Aaaaaaagh! PUT....THAT.....BACK!!!!
HIGH PRICES, HORRIBLE SERVICE! Model Cleaners claimed $3 per shirt, failed tell certain materials (anything cotton) cost $4+!! My total bill double regular bill regular dry cleaners. I went I Groupon. Huge mistake. Absolutely stay away Model Cleaners. I assure service prices SO much better Red Cap Cleaners Runners Cleaners. This place joke!
Absolutely awful service highest prices dry cleaner around Pittsburgh area. Hidden fees upwards $4.50 per shirt exist shirt made cotton! This wasn't made clear I picked shirts Model Cleaners Cochran Road Greentree/Mt. Lebo area received bill upwards $85 expecting $30 charge. The older woman worked front counter location extremely rude short me... absolutely horrible experience beginning end. STAY AWAY
A young child cashier cannot explain services older woman looks back observes confusion caused untrained employee.....first frustration-SHE DOES NOTHING TO HELP! The second lack chairs front really need sit asking much total bill be. I, customer, felt like I bothering bringing business. More competition might change way conduct business. Employees bad attitudes combined outrageous prices makes wonder business sense at. Off Sams....
Model Cleaners failed deliver 4 shirts 2 suits June. I called Manager Tim, many phone calls, said driver malfunction clothes truck suits shirts may delivered wrong location. He said would contact might them. After phone calls later, shirts, suits. Suddenly suits shirts appeared door. I called find out, know delivered. So, I assuming delivered neighbor. I took inventory suits found 4 suits missing! I called left message answer, also left email.... answer either. Today I received call Tim, (August25), I can't afford lose suits. I business elsewhere.
oil change shop.
Made appointment oil change, came next day told would 3 4 hour wait, Even I told guy behind counter I made appointment. They called me,( I gave number I made appointment) I call back, put hold 2x, finally hung up. So incompetent I even get chance rate actual service.
Went years, service continues go hill steadily. When I all-weathers put spring, 'forgot' tighten valve stems, tires flat next morning. Just went winter tires put (figured I'd give another chance years) mess. After several miscommunications guy ringing (neglected tell front tires shot pressed) told would hour two. I signed work order, gave keys headed waiting room...at point, told would 4-5 hours.
Guy front desk attitude problem. A poor expirence overall.
I haven't Wendy's time , WOW What disappointment . The people look like HATE jobs treat customers accordingly. The food horriable. The number one meal sized 99 cent cheeseburger fries tasted like sitting grease year old. The big coke 3/4 ice 1/8 water 1/8 coke. I threw mean garbage. I wont back. If Michael Obama wants us eat ? Well lets see kids eat ! WOW Dave , I bet turning grave , poor bastered !
This Wendy's Terrible. There's nothing fast fast food. Go next door Taco Bell.
I place many many times years. But last visit least year prior. I shocked outside condition restaurant. This place definitely looks like it's falling apart outside. I didn't stay eat, little I saw, inside looked fine. My toasted bagel cream cheese okay, wasn't napkin bag. Seems like silly oversight.
Food would expect BB, staff friendly enough prices outrageous. My boyfriend I endure drive thru running late camping trip. My "toasted" bagel white soft... addition cream cheese. Prices crazy! Don't lazy... drive hill GE... buy 6 pack bagels, cheese bacon 10 bucks! You'll left food cash
Received bad service today. Got wrong chase sandwich, Got decaf tea instead regular tea even though told black tea. Usually ask decaf. However, lots seats since place empty. We left Einstein's crowded. They Missed opportunity impress new customer. Guess it's back Einstein's.
My dad would always take place I little. It nice way start school day. We hadn't gone planning going back. Well, one day, hurry go somewhere dad suggested get brueggers.... Of course went drive thru lady took order snobby. To make matters worse, pulled window one there, dad said would probably second, ten minutes, dad I left. And that, nine minutes late. We upset!
I usually like posting negative reviews. However, experience I last week horrible say least. I asked trim simple layers, woman cut hair, Tiffany, completely messed up. I expect stellar haircut Supercuts expectation fast easy; however, instead receiving simple natural layers I asked for, hair cut two divided stacks. There continuancy one stack obviously two divided layers looked horrible even amateur like could cut better. In addition I asked straight line ends yet many pieces Tiffany missed form straight end. I devastated I got home looked haircut.
Consumer alert... rats!
The close-to-my-childhood-home Starbucks: it's A. Not Peet's, B. An accidental high school reunion I dare venture in. On hand, usually couches--or chairs tables--available, inside outside, depending season. This option I don't want try park Beverly caffeine fix Coffee Tree.
I love Panera food, Panera ranks lowest low! Poor service, menu options available, dirty utensils. I could go on...
This far worst medical treatment / experience " medical facility" I ever had. I recently major neck surgey complications also low back issues. My surgeon town able see almost month suggested go urgent care updated films meds. Of course x rays MRI informing would give medication help muscle spasms keep pain day night. I treated like drug addict insulted. I asking muscle relaxer treated like I offering go staff heroin. When asked could speak "DR" I cut nurse told come back 3 days, im assuming charge another visit. He would even give courtesy explaining syptoms. If intersted padding pockets terrible doctors place you. If seeking genuine medical attention would strongly suggest another facility.
Went place today thinking regular "urgent care" center like MedExpress. A man polo shirt walked exam room said, "I need urine sample." I asked said, "I'm Dr. ______. This clinic." No lab coat, name tag, introduction, nothing. He said needed blood work x-Rays treat upset stomach. I felt uneasy left. Checking website I got home I discovered man nurse practitioner, doctor. I called clinic make sure indeed person. I asked treated told, "Oh, Dr. _____." I asked doctor replied, "No. He's nurse goes Dr. ______." Isn't illegal misrepresent like that? This place seems shady.
I've boy changed, I believe management. Previously waiting room always packed usually good sign. Well, time I person waiting. Leo, MRI Tech, took back explained processed would work got started. After first five minutes ask take pillow lap hot. That told A/C working since I'm claustrophobic I went test. After MRI finished I asked Leo I speak manager lack A/C found broken three weeks way tv tell everyone view test also broken. Leo introduced manager, didn't seem concerned told called yesterday seemed concerned patients subjected temperatures 90 degrees tests last three weeks.
Their service terrible. I ordered basket funeral service online Saturday delivery 2:00 PM viewing Monday. I wanted order phone one answered phone Saturday even though open. When I placed order online I wasn't given option receipt. I was; however, charged basket. I called office Monday morning assured elderly man quick rush phone delivery would time. The delivery never made daytime viewing I called back one answered even though website states hours open. I made several attempts. Don't order shop want timely delivery. They haven't delivered paid service make impossible contact them.
The food service good . The food made scratch premises . The restaurant owned run two brothers Green Tree area . I admire always try give business local family run places like . My gripes limited selection bar I feel prices food expensive portions receive.
Overpriced, slow service, food decent.
Expensive, slow, good food don't mind wait check.
Food mediocre service lousy. I'm sitting right water done eating 20 min...
I disappointed seafood salad. There 3 pcs. shrimp 4 scallops little salad greens alot money. Not worth since everything else wonderful.
I buffalo chicken pizza really enjoyed it! Good quality cheese chicken.. Hearty proportions.. No complaints !
Best pizza area Italian subs good quality Service A1 ya gotta watch Psycho dishwasher busboy every 2 minutes guy comes strolling past table cracking knuckles giving us Evil Eye really weird
Pizza good really expensive. I also got 6 pack cost 14 dollars. The 6 pack cost 7.50 back hometown. When said done pizza, wings, soup, 6 pack cost 50$.
Seriously let's get grip, gnocchi homemade is, isn't soft little pillow pasta, stuff selling isn't homemade, it's bought in. I've eaten gnocchi coast coast grandmother made us, aunts, made us, right I wintersvillle da peppino make home made. Delicious, gnocchi crap, sauce bland, I open sauce pour anything, doesn't mean taste good, taste creations send out? Epic Fail.
Basically, it's ok. The food good, great, consistent. Unfortunately, I've found service also consistent I've dined slow (even busy) uninterested. I've experience ordering take out. They seem like I'm bothering I go ask order.
A back Mom bought donuts really stale next day. She called mentioned something didn't even seem care. I like try support local business attitude like showed I use them. Doesn't seem real set hours never know open.
First one store snowy cold Saturday morning. Twelve people behind me. The donuts good made late opening 7:15 AM. Folks friendly cheerful clearly take pride donuts (and trippy experience) little shack store offers you.
The Pennsylvania Turnpike caught good day. That is, typically unbearable narrow worn-down roadways cluttered "wide loads" various forms temporarily mitigated periodic signage noting "PA TURNPIKE: ALL TOLLS WAIVED." The suspected reason free ride? The major highways Pennsylvania shut due persistent piles snow. STILL. Hey, I'm complaining.
What depressing shell mall... I remember *the* mall go to... CompUSA, Pharmor, Kmart, Playless, Joann Fabrics, ChiChis, Giant Eagle... Hell, CompUSA, ChiChis Pharmor don't even exist anymore... I'm sure Kmarts still business. Dead malls sad, reason. Walking mall creepy though.
Oy vey! Stay away, there's nothing see. Kmart, Phantom attic lottery place. This mall dead! Deader dead, dead dead!
The rooms laid weird, cost rooms worth it. There also many place eat around hotel.
The service great here. The food average. And parking bad.
I ordered food I believed gluten free. Within twenty minutes I started symptoms sick two days. I believe food may gluten free cross contamination caused problem. I experience another Pittsburgh Olive Garden restaurant concluding may careful cross contamination.
Yep, it's chain. Yep it's lot jokes "In know" set. Yep, kind inexplicable long wait weekends. Yep, I know it's politically correct eat locally-owned family restaurant. But know what? I've never bad meal there. I've never less top-shelf service there. I find Olive Garden restaurants consistently higher quality compared franchise stores it's price range, also notably better family owned Italian restaurants I could name.
Avoid costs! They diluted wine water, food mushy, charged $3.25 marinara sauce A CAN (without informing us beforehand injustice would taking place)! Typical big corporation: cut costs last nickel inflate prices CEO fly private jet (after landing, eat REAL Italian restaurant) purchase new Bentley year. Visit DeBlasio's Restaurant twice portions; MUCH CHEAPER, well. Worst experience restaurant... EVER!
Well Sunday night crowd here. I opted bar sit eat found entire wait staff joking tossing salads... No really. The bartender showed try direct sit ... That lasted 5 minutes. Very unprofessional staff far. Well I know waitress' tanning habits dog problems... Her ex must ran, walked away her. The bartender keeping service end despite completely unprofessional staff around him. Food typical Olive Garden surprises there.
The good: -Comfy Bed. This priority hotel HIE-PWG delivered here. -Powerful air conditioning- necessary mornings much drink -Breakfast available decent coffee -Paul, employee worked front desk picked us airport. He really friendly The bad: -The Price! $170 night hotel walking distance anything? Say what? -The tiniest hotel bathroom ever. They could taken 3 feet room add bathroom. It weird. -My keycard room became demagnetized every time left room. I go front desk every time. No good. The ugly- The dried loogie elevator door stayed weekend long. What, you're telling single staff member got elevator grossed dried phlegm eye-level door? Nasty!
Rooms clean amenities fine. My problem hotel double charged stay. I reserved room phone Holiday Inn hotline charged exactly quoted. When I get home Virginia, I discover hotel charged stay, I different amount. I stayed one night charged twice. I phone 5 different people connected Holiday Inn... NONE help. They could either see one charge (depending looking); told call back another time, I working; insinuated I didn't know I talking about. All I want get answer none people give answer. This last time I stay Holiday Inn. Add On: The WiFi awful.
Hotel offers free airport shuttle shuttle service downtown Pittsburgh, service one one van. We waited airport hour half. Staff sincere apology, told could taken cab. We use service returning airport. Room hot. Temp conrols revert back preset hotel, made sleeping uncomfortable. Garage parking unavailable one mentions check sinage garage....yet it's listed amenity web site? Backing onto street garage entrance dangerous. Breakfast understaffed totally ran hot cold food, utensils beverage...all gone! We scored apple day one trip. Took hour restock, tables filthy, casualty trying restock. No manager duty busy morning rush. They concerned quality courtesy services ie shuttle breakfast. Staff argumentative.
This used Holiday Inn Clarion Hotel & Conference Center. We needed find place far Heinz Stadium reasonable price. We paid $90 per night place, experience started poorly. We walked two lobby TVs tuned Judge Judy (for front desk employee's viewing pleasure). Employees watching reality TV business hours really puts off. It hard get attention front desk staff middle pizza order. Two staff working front desk third suggesting toppings. It pretty funny one clerks started set room another phone pizzeria kept interrupting process pizza questions. To side third clerk assisted pizza order. My wife pointed extreme cleavage, I want get lost there. We hard time understanding clerk setting room. She tended mumble, assert better responding pizza order questions. We finally got room headed scary elevator 4th floor. In way I felt sort slum. I kept looking gang tagging. The room adequate (and I believe renovated room), Motel 6 would upgrade. Whoever renovation really poor taste quality work terrible. The swimming pool swamp (I kidding), I sure frogs living good time. The next morning went front desk again. This time morning clerk personal call gave angry look felt I interrupting call. She even hang up; put phone side, answered question, continued conversation. Personally, I think hotel would great horror movie Hollywood contact place. It needs knocked down, management tighten staff improve construction quality. If construction track (and I suspect something wrong), get staff really gracious customers. There people need jobs I assure proper management great job. Don't stay $45 per night (the price due breakfast offered). Personally I would stay fix place, reason I don't feel ever happen. Something feels wrong. Perhaps Clarion stopped remodel due economy.
oh. dear. lord. feel bad tour group japan .... place dumps. 2 rooms: supposed floor. nope. 2 different floors, took 6 rooms 2 rooms NOT dirty. One bed unmade day. Drunk frat rats. AVOID.
This technically Clarion hotel I think name wrong page. I'd like start saying I'm much complainer, could given 0 stars, I would have. So way room passed vending machine water underneath it. I assumed leaking brushed off. I don't care much little things like especially since sleeping there. After great hockey game bar crawl, came back hotel got ready bed. There absolutely hot water shower. So cold I wouldn't even consider hopping really quick. It late I let go decided try morning. When I woke thing. At point I fuming. I NEED shower man! So I put angry pants headed hall towards elevator. Right front elevator door water fall pouring ceiling third floor. "What hell...." pretty much I thinking point. Well shower considering I walk continue quest. As soon elevator doors open first floor, I see hallway flooded. The carpet squishing beneath feet way front desk angry people beaten to. Apparently pipe burst day neglected tell us checked in. I mad. I managed get 70% bill I made call check us another hotel. I would insisted whole bill paid I'm really bad mean people. All all, I never stay branch hotel again.
Nightmare. It's ghost town. Needles parking lot. "Lobby" hotel room undesirables hanging around. Asked see rooms checking in, given key, room filthy. Saw sticky note re: bedbugs. Bolted, fast possible.
Ah, yes, yet said Clarion Greentree, commonly known hotel perpetual construction? Check reviews folks (I sure wish I had) you'll see place construction least four years! My family, I'm sure countless others, initially trouble even finding place humble ask directions nearby Doubletree Hotel. But even directions, drove right past Clarion because: 1). There hotel signs; 2). We arriving night building completely dark; 3). There parked cars visible road; 4). The entire front building boarded up. When located correct driveway approached construction zone, represented entrance hotel, saw tiny sign directing us "Temporary Lobby" back hotel. The makeshift lobby consisted hotel room clerk sitting desk. The clerk initially could locate reservation computer, found soon I dug luggage find copy confirmation email. We given room second floor, thus walked past stairwells closed (because endlessly drying 'wet paint') out-of-order (and leaking) ice machine, located elevator. Well, let tell folks, Disney's Tower Terror ride less frightening elevator. It looked like one service elevators public never sees. The floor covered dead bugs ceiling holes it, leading conclusion someone must taken globes ceiling lights dumped dead bugs onto floor. When got room, carpet covered nasty grease stains wanted keep shoes on. We preliminary check beds found stained sheets, thankfully bugs. We also checked free Wi-Fi signal found completely useless (maybe that's desk clerk couldn't locate reservation). Finding complimentary breakfast morning like scavenger hunt, look clues small paper signs hallways. The adventure actually took outside hotel back another part building (thankfully wasn't raining like night). I realized I entered main construction zone outside route must passable route dining area. There yet another sign outside dining room said something Complementary Breakfast strange phrase "Gratuity Included." But inside dining room least two clearly-marked 'Tip Jars.' Now, I've pretty trashy hotels travels, I've never seen tip jar dining room. I've also never hotel dining room looked like bomb gone off, drop cloths, power tools sorts debris everywhere. When I got line grub, I learned attendant earned tips: help patrons identify food. The person front inquired gray-looking sausage-like links dutifully informed represented turkey sausage, adding, "Because Clarion cares health." I'm kidding (who could make something like up?). Anyway, I tried so-called health food, hot alternative French Toast I want syrupy food morning. Guess what? The sausage kind sugary additive make links taste like syrup! Real healthy, right? Thus, I ended getting cup coffee returning room pack up. The coffee okay, way. In conclusion, I would stayed Greentree Clarion I made prior reservations coming back midnight following music festival rained day. Plus, used loyalty points room, I couldn't even request discount. Believe me, HUD would shut place apartment building Dept. Homeland Security would never even consider housing immigrants there. But, course, I welcome pay upwards hundred bucks night stay there.
This far worst hotel experience I've ever had. It wasn't MASSIVE construction going on, nothing accommodate it. They put us dirty floor exposed ceilings, spackle, sheetrock everywhere. The lights broken room filthy. The second room air conditioning unit wouldn't reach outlet, rendering useless middle summer, toilet paper water bathroom floor. The CHILDREN working front desk, located hotel room, gave worst customer service, greeted attitude, couldn't manage pull away conversation long enough even check timely manner. The worst. Do stay here.
Wish I could give place negative stars. Where begin? It begins signs saying hotel at. And goes "temporary lobby" room turned office. The whole place construction wouldn't bad, gosh crap EVERYWHERE!!! That leads us elevator. Norman bates would even say it's creepy him. It's marked two different hotel names top that, holiday inn ramada. Then room. Not worst worst, decor nice, bed hard rock shower isn't even properly installed. Really wish I would looked yelp booking here. Buyer beware. Oh yea! AND I knew construction booked June, promised construction would done hand. Extremely disappointed.
Don't even think staying hotel. If option giving zero available, I would definitely use it. I travel living, stayed hotels renovated WORST experience I've ever had. Rude staff: front desk attendant wrapped blanket, watching move feet propped counter. She couldn't tear away movie address me. Construction sure: hotel 2 full gas cans left front door, empty case beer cans right beside flowing trash cans walked in. Filthy would step actual conditions. It hasn't cleaned months. It smelled paint chemicals. When I raised concerns front desk clerk said manager meet discuss conditions owner knew state place didn't care. I made reservation Booking.com, called immediately sent photos document experience.
I actually never wanted write bad review experience office staff almost month I decided warn others. I've seeing doctor office five years, great service front clerical staff, terrible like experienced last several weeks. All took trying get prescription filled insurances online pharmacy currently searching new PCP due incompetence unmannerly behavior women front end practice. October 2nd mail order prescription company Cigna sent request two prescriptions doctor sent 3-Month Supply. I called office left message doctor stating request Cigna faxing request. A days later phone call returned I spoke one women office. She assured would send message back. About week later, I received letter insurance company stating faxed office THREE times response. I called office last Monday ( 2 weeks...same issue, one returned phone call). I spoke another LIVE PERSON knowing leaving messages doctor pointless point women understand courtesy calls. I assured woman would handling issue day, I offered phone number pharmacy incase faxing hard (obviously) I could get refills end month. She told need number, time, electronic. ::bangs head desk:: I ask call back day I may ease taken care of. I immediately call insurance company hanging hoping arent incompetent maybe Cigna dropped ball. That case, I given dates times doctors office contacted. I ask send yet another fax doctor day incase women office lost paperwork. 17 BUSINESS DAYS LATER, I receive automated phone call WALGREENS... Walgreens? Yes, folks 17 business days 3-4 calls doctor later, office sent one month supply medicine Walgreens. No, people cannot possibly stupid. I patient calm women. I two doctors sent prescription refill requests day office prescriptions already filled, shipped sitting counter well week point. At point I want office manager, turned joke. I called office back... (after spending 45 minutes phone Cigna restarting prescription request THEY CANCELLED IT due contact office..yes, long CANCELLED order) I speak extremely rude hello woman named Julie, Julianne, I dont even know. She would transfer office manager like I asked, told woman I spoke earlier week wasn't I would leave message. I explained going weeks. No one returns calls office, I needed situation resolved today. She told nothing office staff, doctor. I blown nothing resolved simply assurance Julie phone call would returned afternoon. Yet again, one courtesy call, nothing resolved. At point I faith $50.00 order placed McDonalds drive thru would handled better respect stoned 15 year old child office staff. I personally go office (on opposite end town), late job speak someone person tomorrow. I may even make actual appointment doctor point made aware poorly front end handled. It shame many years start new doctor due office staff alone- future clientele beware
I wish I didn't give even 1 star. Horrible service. I ordered family dinner 4 plus 2 extra sides. I got sighs eye rolls cook girl waiting me. I got home extra sides. I paid didn't put bag. I called told would send card family dinner 3 since charged items received. I called July 2nd never sent anything. I spoke Autumn advised manager would send gift card previously promised. Still received. So choose location make sure check order love charge items won't receive follow through. I would happy get 10.00 back. This started June 24th. Terrible servce. We went least 1x month problem spending money, I'd rather spend 60.00 somewhere else. Mediocre food, horrible service, zero follow through. My advice, avoid place.
What I say place ? I several good experiences several bad experiences years . All , get see . The service hit miss depending working . I feel bit expensive quality food get . The place small especially counter area .
Junk worse McDonald. My wife fan shop Fairfax VA. Westopped quick breakfast. The poppers stale bagels hard worst thing heated egg omlette microwave. For someone use home, shock.. threw stuff trash can.. whole thing cost 25$..you decide worth
Horrible experience made sandwich wrong 3rd visit. Will never back. Ever
Horrible service! 2 time row I got order wrong. First time I ordered smoked salmon puppysead bagel cream cheese tomatoes capers gave honey salmon sweet disgusting charged side I didn't ask , I looked receipt I like hell side?! So give chips... Which I don't really need. Today I gave 2 chance. Same order. Guess I got? Puppysead bagel SALMON SPREAD!!!! For real, wasting money wrong order!!!! I hope manager gonna read this. First time I got sandwich soooo good that's get star. But screw twice order I don't wanna waste money again! Enjoy 20$ took wrong order!!!
It's sad. I used get great service location. Today girls behind counter rude zero personality. After waiting 8 minutes bagel sandwich yelled order basically threw bag counter. I live right around corner go back again. They may want look getting new team members value job understand value customer service.
Service terrible. Waited 15 minutes bagel cream cheese line.
I agree others, service slow. I stopped way appointment bring me, big mistake busy line. However, 3 employees working 2 working actively serving taking orders. They employee I don't know what. It shouldn't take 15 minutes get dozen bagels. At least bagels good.
I'm thinking place give people can't function normal job place work . Horrible service food.
I stopped yesterday morning I attending off-site training session. Typical Starbucks. On way back, I bought new Starbucks VIA instant coffee try office. VIA taste like brewed coffee, Starbucks loses one star that.
This decent location happen near Market Square you're craving Starbucks. It gets crazy busy parking tough since it's touristy location, lines move pretty quick always seem adequately staffed. Unfortunately, location limited retail area. We looking pick Verismo pods didn't carry last time there. Odd.
A normal Starbucks.. A little cramped..
Worst effin Starbucks block baristas suck making drinks. Horrible customer service ALWAYS screw orders. I don't understand they're lazy. I understand comprehension level low lack education though. But, hate job, don't take loyal customers! Your life sucks, get it, ONE job Starbucks, right. It's hard.
Came "quick" breakfast way hotel Fallingwater, regretted decision immensely. Extremely long lines, poorly trained staff. As former employee, I know staff roles approximately long take receive drink. This staff trained all, clear overwhelmed crowd. It took 32 minutes receive order (there 7 customers front me), order incorrect. I ordered small coffee, medium latte, croissant sausage breakfast sandwich. I know sausage sandwiches heat 40 seconds oven, I can't comprehend took long get order. Would never come again. I also received WARM cheese danish instead croissant. First, warm, creamy colored goo middle extremely unappetizing, second, looked dejected I pointed I ordered croissant I almost left. Do recommend.
Not exactly fan location, however I tend frequent work location, I always leave unsatisfied. The baristas friendly. I'm always always always made feel like I'm stupid (seriously? i'm ordering coffee - gave Masters Degree things brewed?) they're rude. Just.... rude. I've never issue order accurate, although again, ordering coffee people. I'm asking recite Gettysburg address.. Latin.. backwards. Just asking coffee.. congrats getting right! I wwill also add everytime I go store, smells.. bad. real bad. like delicious aroma fresh brewed coffee. No no. You know febreze commercials take disgusting atmosphere smell throw poor, unsuspecting victims test febreze-ee-ness area? Yeah, it's like that. Only febreze. To sum up, I would suggest you're area need starbucks life, take extra steps go one corner 6th penn. Those people SUPER friendly (gave free coffee new years day I way work realized I forgot credit card I ordered coworkers.. nice!) smells like coffee shop smell - like coffee. WHOA.. mind. blown.
This Satrbucks location dirty! It daily normal , ordinary dirt. The glass case dust fingerprints it. The fingerprints main doors look like ones 2 months ago. The cafe area looks hasnt seen broom mop months either. Not sure manager makes th e employees clean not! Would rather go Dunkin Donuts next time! Right across square. My macchiato bitter taste it!
I should've believed already written It close hotel. The WORST mani/pedi life. I'm 43. I'm flight attendant. I've LOT nail salons. I swear wasn't licensed. She clue claims nails 40 years. She clearly needs retire male owner a$$. He says "not everyone same." Well..... They certainly come close!! No cuticle push back. Didn't know remove gel polish. Didn't file straight smooth. Didn't clean nails lotion. I tell take alcohol nails clean lotion remind use base coat. Then polished cuticle. 17 hours later done nothing sleep workout shower polish chipped 6 nails.
I guess last good review Princess nails. Unfortunately worst possible thing happened. I one eyebrow! Its slowly growing back idea pencil eyebrow everyday starting get me. Unfortunately I don't know happened? Michelle going blind? Are okay? Obviously left completely mishapen eyebrows I someone else fix botched mine. I cried, I weeped, found fetal position. I'm longer going back. I know people days BAD.
Went get gel nails taken straight told no. NO? Fine, that's money pocket I never set foot diseased infested looking store.
This worse nail salon I ever to! I staying nearby hotel recommended it, soon I returned hotel I told NEVER recommend salon anyone ever again. It's disorganized, dirty, limited selection polishes (the ones clearly old). I went gel manicure, took arrogant young woman almost 30 minutes take gel polish I nails. Why? Because SO stingy acetone cotton. When I said something it, snapped me. She unprofessional downright nasty. The final bow charging high-end spa quality prices horrible service. This place needs closed - STAY AWAY!!
I got good haircut months ago, one-star review intended stylists. It response strict no-returns policy salon products, makes pretty mad: I couldn't known recommended wrong product without trying it, I tried it, won't refund purchase. Catch-22. I came buy replacement normal bumble bumble curl creme thick hair, told receptionist bumble bumble's "defining creme fine curls" new packaging product (which seemed weird begin with...thick hair..fine curls...) Nope, it's totally different doesn't work me. I used twice, figured out, I'm stuck expensive product I can't use. I called bumble bumble told product I use discontinued. All previous salons cities would honored return situation. I won't back MCN.
I, too, decided MCN based Yelp reviews moving Pittsburgh. Unfortunately, I great experience others did. I ended getting probably worst haircut I'd 10 years. It ended good 4 inches shorter I discussed stylist. In addition, took fact I work professional office mean I wanted ugly, boring, mom-ish haircut. It's taken almost year grow back length before. I admittedly complained there, I'm wuss. Additionally, experience salon left much desired. I went late morning weekday. There little girl (around 3 4) nanny. Apparently mom regular customer. The little girl getting haircut cried screamed 25 minutes. I know kids kids, I don't blame little girl scared cranky. I blame salon finding way girl disrupt entire salon - taking back room, taking outside calm down, allowing children adult, supposedly high-end salon, etc. Something supposed treat turned headache. I back here, seems like others great experiences.
I agree reviews Salon so. First, I feel like pull prices thin air. The price either increased services stayed less services. Second, I felt like colorists/hair stylist Heather slight lazy didn't like highlights. Every time I came pushed color me, even though I getting highlight years never color. The color right often left hair brassy looking. Finally, overall prices way high. I City Chicago, prices cheaper Salon high end salons Michigan Avenue. Now I get better service much cheaper Wexford Dolce Vita.
Let start saying I moved state adored prior stylist salon I knew finding someone going tough. I went MCN recommendation fellow bottle blonde course year half, I've seen two different stylists MCN (Nicolette left last summer Ashley) - fine. Color fine, cut fine. That's - fine. Actual styling non-existent. I shorter hair used real blowout style - blew dry,. Which would fine price cut/highlights wasn't close $200 (after living Baltimore Nashville, exceptionally expensive I used to). They also SHOVE products throat - ridiculous annoying. I also didn't like fact given visit, I'd main stylist probably least two people 'work' - either washing hair, putting toner (which I asked repeatedly NOT use) finishing highlights. I can't stand it's one reasons I won't go back. Overall, I found dreading going get hair done I'm spending kind money time someplace, I'd like least sort enjoy experience. Something remember - take cash tips.
Me wife went salon first time haircuts, Ashley Margo haircuts, pretty good. We satisfied haircuts. But honor rude person, two year old touched plant placed waiting area, came yelled said expensive, felt really bad dog roaming salon getting people's stuff, good idea. I allergic dogs people don't like dogs. All staff nice courteous. Though like services going back owner manners rude.
I'm sure I return MCN salon. However, haircut I received source disappointment annoyance MCN. Upon arrival, I offered coffee stylist prepared I pleased. I instructed leave belongings coat room put robe. In so, I left coffee side counter front salon. I quickly ushered back shampoo, condition, Kerastase treatment. I realized I forgot cup went back front retrieve it. As I politely ask woman behind desk saw it, cuts mid sentence inform thrown away gives sneer. As I look bewilderment handle rudeness rolls eyes asks I still want something drink. UM, YES? That's I'm looking cup now. She instructs I'm wait finish making drink deliver chair. Yeah, no. Never that. But take time come stylist, glare me, inform stylist next client here. Rude. I thanked stylist time pay cut style. Only I realize friend also received free Kerastase treatment MCN's birthday special. They charged standard, $30. Well, woman behind counter basically told needed see proof email offer existed. Why didn't I show email get free treatment? She basically giving Asian friend terribly difficult time. Between friends, spent $1,000 salon going treat loyal clients so? I also believe salon desperately needs dress code enforced staff. If go MCN, take look around, agree me. Finally, leave pooches home. I don't particularly like large dog roams around slobers leg pants appointment. 1 star, thank stylist great cut. 5 stars you.
I've good experiences (especially Heather), time I HORRIBLE experience Ashley. I went color cut. She 15 minutes late appointment greeted me, left standing coat closet plastic robe-thing waiting almost ten minutes. For first half appointment, Ashley's mother waiting hair done daughter seemed staring daggers even though I appointment paying good money hair colored cut. Ashley completely overbooked complained busy frantic--NOT something want hear someone styling coloring hair! I felt uncomfortable like I putting even there. I understand coloring takes time, left waiting MANY times entire appointment ended three hours. When came time cut hair, didn't really I wanted spent 5-10 minutes cut. I missed appointments I scheduled hair appointment starving angry time finished me. I didn't even energy complain charged ~$250 terrible experience. I won't returning again.
Came looking decent non-barbershop haircut. Booked appointment Heather since site said good Asian hair. Heather definitely experienced Asian hair. After shown pictures I wanted haircut, completely lost even approach cutting hair. She also kept asking accent I "really from" despite born lived US entire life speaking perfect English. She seemed pretty confused idea Asian person born here. Overall, Heather came ignorant unfamiliar common Asian haircuts. I would recommend MCN anyone. $50 tip outrageous ended experimental haircut unskilled unprofessional stylist. If you're looking decent haircut Asian male, definitely go Hair G&E. They're people Pittsburgh right.
Went get haircut yesterday big expectations place since I read Yelp reviews. My hairstylist friendly gave really bad haircut. It even layers don't compromise hair texture, style all. Very disappointed. Will return place.
I booked appointment yelp, I reached mcn, appointment system , said "sorry , call something opens up". Really? Need honor client appointments, problem yelp booking system works work. Such waste time rude. Do think people much time come mcn anytime mcn prefers? Proof:Hi Swati, Congratulations! Your appointment MCN Salon confirmed Wednesday, June 8, 6:55 pm. This appointment booked Intuit Local.
Very sloppy! No attention polish fingers disappointing aggravating I'm going pay money else get redone
They suck!! First even 24 hours I got acrylics one broke, painted french white tips fine, however poor job. When I came back ask refund rude refused help. I gotten nails done almost year I never seen poor job. DO NOT GO HERE.
I would put 0 star possible!!! The worse manicure life !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I decided try salon today I ask manicure Chinese man shrieks me: WHAT COLOR YOU WANT!!!!! He long, gross fingernails dirt underneath He picks said dirt WHILE massaging hands oil stuff. painted nails done I looked horror. It looked like child done it. The bottom sloppy I nail polish skin fingers looked horribly unprofessional. I somewhere right appointment I said that's good job grab hand pure polish remover finger start screaming Chinese language. I shock. This guy control definitely something wrong him. He can't around people . People BE WARE DO NOT GO THERE !!!!!!
Thank fixing nails b&t messed up! You're lifesaver! Basically, long story short, b&t salon messed nails REALLY badly. You see review yelp page. I walked street Kenny's nail salon (which I visited point park university several years before) lady nice enough put quite quickly fix messy job b&t did!
Thank fixing nails b&t messed up! You're lifesaver!
Very poor quality work. I nails done 3 times time I disappointed won't returning. First shellac manicure chipped within week. I let go went back due convenience. Got full set exact thing happened 5 days later. They must use cheap product lower costs. I getting nails done 20 years disappointed poor quality nails. Pedicure's overpriced basically nothing. It basically soak cleaned nail beds. Hardly massaging!! It 20 minutes long. They try upcharge nag services there. Very dirty inside well. Do waste money.
These worst nails I ever 9 years I've getting nails done. The guy nails didn't even take old red polish off, shows new nail polish. Every nail crooked also!! & told pick gel color color wheels, I tried choosing 4 different ones didn't ANY them!! The reason I giving 2 stars instead 1 took right away lunch & got done really fast. I've gotten nails done quickly though much better quality. No matter desperate short time are, try stay away place!
I unfortunately stuck due corporate contract going make sure company rethinks move ASAP !! The staff unfriendly carefree attitude. I water apartment 2 days building manager rude raising hands stating helpless cant anything !! This first time either. The windows don't open apartment couldn't anything either. I living closed long time. God Damn corporate contract tying live !! Please choose live here, especially considering careless rude attitude building manager.
Look place else. I give property 2 stars strictly based awesome location. The lack professionalism, security, responsiveness, follow accountability gets old around first 2 months. The security guards joke. Unfortunately pmc property group bought many different residential buildings downtown- I hear management same. The good news, new renovations done ownership- look those! Or even strip district! Stuck lease February. Among complaints renovations done done half assed, recessed lighting flickers constantly, microwave doesn't work told use liquid dishwasher detergent "fix" dishwasher problems. I could go on. I moved DC, paying almost rent getting horrible deal.
Lots LCD HD Screens make good place check game. The atmosphere little bland, bar part hotel it's connected to, can't expect crazy. All decent bar.
Went watch College National Champ game. Was crowded would think Monday. I didn't eat here. Had drinks all. Cool place hang out. Would like go
My food plain boring. Our service sub-par; asked water first got didn't show shortly got check. The dumb ass waitress spilled water floor table didn't bother cleaning one older ladies joining got slipped fell. The manager duty apologize, it. There offer comp anything basically turned around went business despite us pointing water floor caused fall. Fortunately one seriously injured, I really don't think staff handled situation sort intelligence empathy. The place noisy pricey.
I'm staying hotel soho located I thought would convenient place eat dinner. Well, overpriced food terrible. I ordered chicken parm pasta got go room. The pasta looked tasted like days old soggy, chicken overdone (dry), tiny (super tiny) roll dry stale. Very bad food overpriced. Not food huge disappointment bartender took order unfriendly helpful. She began pour beer tap glass sprayed beer didn't say word, though I met eye contact soon happened. She interested talking waitresses.......you know got great tip :) Try another place food even step outside hotel, bunch places eat across street baseball stadium right next hotel....Atrias pretty good nice wait staff. http://www.atrias.com/
I wish could give place stars! sat lunch lunch rush 2 table restaurant besides ours, ordered blt chili cesar salad....1 hour latler stale BLT chili looked like sitting 2 hours comes out. I still waiting cesar salad. The chili cold blt bread hard couldnt bite it. When asked speak manager waitress got defensive... manager came explained food made wasnt sure problem. After argument going back forth ensued agreed comp meals. Here kicker haha...we going leave waitress tip clearly fault however, came asked problem resolved said yes rolled eyes walked away. No tip friend. This business especially options BESIDES SOHO choose lunch.
Nice looking place worst service i've last 20 years. After waiting 10 minutes bartender less half full bar acknowledge us ordered drinks arrived. Hope need one round waiting 30 minutes try order second round paid exact change save us wasting another hours life. It hard explain oblivious bar tenders were.
Soho disappointing. Lunch crowded, sat bar, even though open table 3 window. We 4, wouldn't let us put extra seat open table. It also loud weekday, noise tables carrying easily. I ordered french dip sandwich, risotto side. To credit, risotto delicious, tiny portion, I inhaled time. Especially considering french dip boring. The meat cheese bland sauce far many herbs it. Not mention, food definitely over-priced. I don't think I'd go back, I did, I'd order risotto nothing else.
I got buffalo chicken salad. No complaints. Wasn't best salad I ever worst. You can't complain much, location convenient. It seems like would great game.
Bar next stadium Typical bar next stadium place Waitresses def looking jobs Not happy This isn't even game night
We looking food late night Thursday nothing open. Since staying spring hill suites thought we'd give try. We afraid would expensive. Flipped menu sandwiches. Had burger turkey burger hot dog chicken sandwich side $9-10. We thought good late night options. Food came hot fresh. My chicken sandwich grilled nicely plenty juice left in. Homemade chips side. Place large clean. Pirates town walked right 10am Thursday night. Full bar didn't order anything.
No redeeming qualities here. Schwill tap. Food terrible - pizza, mac & cheese bites, spinach & artichoke dip. It hardly edible. Stay away.
Had chicken sandwich, sister guiltless chicken. 30 minutes ordering, waitress came ask ordered forgot put order in. Food flavorless, plain. Was nights ago drinks game, waiter wouldnt allow 3 us sit 4 top table (but party 1 sitting 4 top right next table going sit at). Do even tables 3?? 15 minutes later... asked manager allowed us sit there. Overall, close spot PNC given experiences, wouldnt return.
Stayed @ hotel. Ordered sirloin steaks. No steak knife, mashed potatoes, asparagus ordered. So, Check order. I mean 2 person $50 meal tip I would hope waitstaff would deliver ordered & asked left. But skip 20%, $10 room service fee & http://www.sohopittsburgh.com. walk downstairs.
Menu room said "1/2 price apps 5-7pm everyday" menu elevator said "1/2 price apps 5-7pm everyday" menu restaurant read "1/2 price apps 5-7pm everyday" everyday mind menus. Guess game I told. What mean? Pirates, Steelers, Penguins etc? What day game? What joke. THEY DO NOT HAVE 1/2 PRICE APPS!!!! Somewhat slow service somewhat overpriced. $13 burgers, $4 domestic bottles. Look elsewhere lot surrounding place options.
I got cobb salad, prior pirate game, almost lettuce, chicken frozen microwaved warm....daughter got buffalo chicken wrap tasted poor, even 14 year son would eat it. (He eats anything)
If I could rate zero stars I would. Their pizza nothing glorified "Lunchable". That son's description, spot on. I can't understand place stays business. I eaten pizza Italy, I know good pizza, even pizza!!! It's thick cracker like dough canned sauce (tastes like that) COLD cheese covering everything. JUST AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The pizza different traditional place. They bake dough sauce pour toppings cold. It reminds Lunchable pizza snacks I used eat I little ingredients separate put together yourself. This pizza joint isn't one places fall love immediately. Eating pizza cold toppings bit strange first, get pretty good actually. It took tries started growing I find craving often. Its pretty awesome give soooo much topping slice too. I usually get take place small seating area eat at. This isn't one places must eat restaurant since pizza cold anyways.
I disliked cold cheese cold pepperoni crust. Obviously many people like it. I went way go there, heard cold cheese gimmick. Not cup tea...just heads go compare pizzerias. Not comparable top ten pizza joints Pittsburgh.
hands slept pizza shop pittsburgh. best opinion. cold toppings badass say least. typical pizza puts light years ahead rest pizza game.
I really wanted like place alas wasn't happening. They put WAY much cheese everything. I know, say, one possibly much cheese. We ordered salad topped probably cheese vegetables, I dig lettuce out. Then pizza much cheese top cold cheese wasn't able really melt piled high. I could see cold cheese would good melted together amount didn't work. Also toppings (mushrooms peppers) cooked, FYI - I expecting raw since I thought said toppings raw. When I got home I awful stomachache cheese. Totally fault, still, watch out. This first visit though, I dunno, maybe it's always cheese-rific. Or really love cold shredded mozzarella cheese, might place you.
Went lunch hoagie, fries 2 cuts. Took order right away great lunch break limited. After waiting long time went check order said hoagie done cuts forgot French fries. Was willing fries order getting late, cuts still done asked refund willing do. As began processing refund guy comes cuts box . Though great can't eat least take back work. Get work open box tons cheese COLD (I know serve cheese put usually melts little heat pizza pizza cold melted all. No oven toaster oven work heat lunch Friday. Maybe like hour half lunch may work. Friend hoagie good got little cold waiting cuts never get fries.
I've coming years I always enjoy pizza. I recognize lot staff I first started coming too, they've always treated well. The slices come quite bit cheese, cheese cold. As people said reviews, tends love hate thing, I've seen people get pizza baked, don't want cold toppings. I always get slice tomatoes, slice onion, third slice random topping. Three slices plenty, I sometimes get fourth slice take home later. The things I don't like place parking outside seating availability dining area; hectic peak hours might stand around bit table open up. Those aren't enough keep coming back though!
Pizza good cold cheese place Always dirty one wipes tables. He employees walk dirty tables people sit them.
My family I always loved Betos! However, last experience saddened me. My daughter I ordered pizza slices eat togo. After finishing mine, inquired take out. After waiting 15 minutes ( around 45 minutes arrived I ate pizza), presented cold, sauce less piece pizza, wrapped smashed pizza box top, wrapped tape. We left without complaining really upset experience. Shame Betos poor customer service product!
Terrible experience! I appointment inspection still waited loooong time. They strongly suggested services I didn't actually need (cleaning brakes!?) we're pushy extra services (lifetime alignment). Stay away unless you're buying tires!
Yay! I'm fan - So Far ... Fingers Crossed. I made random stop way home check price tire mount since place minutes walk live. Came back next morning around 9am (Sunday) drop car tire mount along fixes including brake pad/rotor replacement alignment. After reading recent negative reviews - I hesitant first extra maintenance (brake pad/rotors alignment) gave shot since price quoted brake pad/rotors alignment much better places. The turn around time bit longer I expected I understand since ran issues working car.
Very disappointed dry cleaner. Had small hole set pants belt buckle. Came back hand stitches messy noticeable. Definitely worth expensive prices.
Can't go wrong ice cream! Tons flavors, really sweet people working plenty place sit inside.
Small dark opening friendly place. Will returning. The floor dirty. The bathrooms small tgey stink lock broken womans side. No food offered. Maybe u ask. I got vodka cran watered down. The good thing free parking back.
Living Dormont 6 months I always wanted see inside. Hadn't even read reviews beforehand. It Karaoke tonight, fav whatever. I left work 1am, wanted last call round heading bed. The bar waitress, cute button didn't even acknowledge us 40's & 60's yrs old sat ate pizza instead asking us wanted drink. Was drinking behind bar honey distracted friends? We walked bar cocktail, guess place.
FYI: New happy hour specials awful. Just awful. Sorry guys, much love I've got put food somewhere. Even raising prices apps 3.99 would've better taking pierogie (aka potato pockets) special together. Won't back.
This americanized German food. For real German food, go Hofbrauhaus ask schnitzel.
I've easy place meet dinner friend. I enjoyed eating well enough. I'm honestly die-hard fan German food, although I guess wouldn't mattered: peak menu beforehand revealed place's menu mostly Americanized - proof fact salad topped French fries (only Pittsburgh...). Trust me, even don't really like German food, there'll least sandwich you'll like here. Thinking usual "overall" summary, I say place wasn't bad served reasonable place meet - beer menu looked nice I saw atmosphere pretty cozy even nostalgic homely - man, dining options really weren't extraordinary. I'm still torn feel menu, one hand obviously Americanized meant even I could find something enjoy, I feel bad people like German food may getting hope for. It wasn't bad enough I'd say don't try see - understand may exactly expect.
Usually I pick single item meal, usually one schnitzel meals. Recently went sampler platter. Really good way get several different tastes. Always look forward meal here.
I was.very disappointed food. If want bland tasteless food, stop here. They need get 70's decor. I ordered corned beef cabbage sandwich, edible enjoyable. Don't waste money much better choices
The words "epic fail" get thrown around lot days....but I really feel like apply situation. We went Friday, April 2 arrived 5:10pm. It busy, crowded....no waiting table. Half price apps drinks -- ordered 5:20. The food (just appetizers, mind you...) didn't arrive till almost 6pm. Drinks ordered unbelievably slow. We placed one order 6 draft beers 6:15...they arrived 6:52. *37 minutes beer.* By 7:00, canceling food orders we'd given waiting almost hour. We wanted leave. Instead comping anything, added 18% gratuity bills. Uhhhh yeah. Thanks giving one reason never come back. We finally able leave around 7:30. Bar Louie: You dead me.
I EXACT experience John R. Went get quick bite eat seeing movie across street. The place near empty three waitresses. Got seated waited immediately. Ordered drinks, took 15 minutes come...no, alcoholic drinks, two waters iced tea. This bad sign, point ordered food. 20 minutes go by...we flag waitress, let know need get movie 45 minutes. She said food would minutes. Another 20 minutes, still food, waitress nowhere seen. We flag another waitress, says find waitress, notice chatting one waitresses. She finishes conversation finally makes way table five minutes later. She says didn't even realize food hadn't arrived (well, never even checked us, course didn't). After speaking kitchen staff, informs us "definitely" put order "must given someone else mistake." Because wouldn't noticed WASN'T ordered? Seriously? The waitress told us could give us food take and, since starving, reluctantly agreed. 10 minutes later, food bill arrived. All comped iced tea, got free utensils wetnaps. How generous! We shovelled could mouths, NOT leave tip (thankfully, didn't added gratuity John had), sprinted movie covertly finished smuggled food. Worst part? I opened wetnap, totally dry. Of course. However, I gave place two stars instead one. That's food, I finally got it, perfect. I Greek burger huge, cooked exactly I like it, delicious toppings. I really wish I could come back food but...hell no.
We going see movie started 9:40pm. The 2 us got Bar Louie 8:30. We sat outside, nearly 30 minutes waiter even stopped get order. I tried stopping waitress told 'this isn't table'. Finally waiter took order. 1 Sam Adams light bottle, one Pineapple Juice+Vodka. After 15minutes another waiter (maybe manager I don't know) asked waited on. We said yes, told waiting. He left, another (different) waitress came bring us drinks.. wrong.. My date given vodka rocks. I given Sam Adams.. They took back, another 10 minutes correct order served.. We told bring another round check. It 20 minutes returned.. forgot check. By time go time movie.. date asked check could leave.. finally brought I gave card, came back signed left hurry catch movie. 2 bottle beers, 2 pineapple juice + vodka I charged $31.03. I didn't time complain ask. I won't going back.
I came last night get appetizers movie, hoping able write review food. Unfortunately, I cannot service bad I left I chance order. We found seats bar behind taps. After sitting 5 minutes acknowledged, thought might able see us, moved different pair seats middle bar, grabbing menus way would ready order. It fairly busy, like people standing bar trying get drinks - everyone seated I'm sure face much busier times. We sat new seats almost 15 minutes (I timed - I exaggerating), even acknowledged. You would least think bartender would acknowledge us tell us would us could, despite staring almost whole time, could even make eye contact. I hope fluke probably back find out.
The absolute worst service I ever bar restaraunt. And, looking reviews, I first. There many options Waterfront, I would suggest try them; stay far away place!
Servers chatting, paying attention tables. I see salad ready window. Worst serves ever.
Mediocre poorly made! You get better quality food Mcdonalds don't waste time money
I would give eat n park location zero stars I could. I arrived 11:15am seated quickly it. My waitress come 11:41. I receive water service 26 minutes. That outrageous me, I've never anything good say location visiting again.
This usually favorite late night hot spot. And tonight waitress real gem, dime dozen. My fruit cup sadly bad, easily worst melon/honeydew I've ever had. But thank goodness, waitress brought extra banana slices. Good night, bad melon. That's . come again. Will order fruit night though.
Who love DQ Blizzard? And I heart Girl Scout Thin Mint Blizzard. Next time, I get mini size. The small filled I finished!
No complaints here! Me girlfriend stop least week. Cashier always nice order always comes couple minutes less.
Don't waste time. Incorrect orders norm. It's fairly disgusting (sticky tables, trash everywhere). The last time stopped seven people working...but maybe actually three work. The four checking cellphones standing around talking. There one young girl works ass rest contribute chaos.
Not fan "german" place. Simply awful. We ordered Potato Pancake Reuben Traditional Reuben. So much gristle meat. Very low quality food price. The bar cool, stopped past enjoyed atmosphere bar. Bar yes. Food/Restaurant no.
I can't even review place. We sat waited waitress take order, waited waited got tired left. And I clear Saturday afternoon, maybe like 10 tables people I saw 3 waitress walking around. I think it's probably bad idea ignore people come restaurant, especially since burgatory opened across street.
The food okay. The noise level--with 10 people huge room--deafening. Awful acoustics!
I went evening. The chop chop salad awesome. The shrimp tempora bready. The bartenders awful.
Food 7 10 type bar / restaurant. Service extremely poor bar service also extremely poor. Untrained understaffed bartenders keep coming back. No reason able get drink sitting bar.
Well it's 9pm Tuesday tater tots. Dip chips cold beer room temperature. Not happy. Will try station square bar Louie next time.
My friends I went waterfront enjoy shopping dinner. Everywhere pretty busy went Bar Louie upset took least ten minutes server come table. He immediately brought waters ordered drinks. Only another 30 minutes brought ONE martini over. We ordered food talking management still took 45 minutes order messed up. We tried understanding learned servers first day would think management would try help poor guy out! He didn't get weeds 2 hours there. Very disappointing embarrassing managements part. We weren't people horrible service looked around bar everyone upset. I hope let server get experience rather feeding wolves second day.
Sign stated "Seat Yourself" know service would horrible moment walked in. We originally sat upstairs, open per sign. After 20 minutes got went outside. After 20 minutes outside waitress taking care making small talk table next us, said screw walked. The one time I service so-so. I never go back. Why I try track people pay meal?!?
Should checked reviews went. I've "real" Bar Louie's cities. This one them. Was seated 20 min wait staff came take order. Several made eye contact feel need ask waited on. Awkward. Then someone came two plates food trying serve us. We thought, big chance get served, no, walked away. So left. There many restaurants get burgers, go someplace else.
I walked Bar Louie wait table Burgatory. We sat bar one bartender half acknowledged us said would "be us minute". We continued sit wait. While talked employees walked around bar talk servers. The bartender slowly walking around end bar. When finally make way end greeted people sat ignored us sitting 7 minutes. This NOT busy time therefore excuse us wait 2 minutes drink. We got walked never back. I never good experience Bar Louie matter been. Their customer service always subpar. Awful.
Worst bar I ever to. They used maybe alchohol drinks consistency meaning here. We ordered three berry mojitos different significantly. I posted picture, judge.
I went work friends catching movie later night. We got Bar Louie little 2 hours movie started, left us hardly time spare time done. We table right away server took drink orders, took 15 minutes get drinks. She disappeared 30 minutes coming back take food order. The food took almost hour, ordered couple appetizers. The portions really small price, food came burnt. I risk mentioning thought waiting another hour new food. Again, waiting server bring checks meal ordeal took much longer have. The place busy, overcrowded, I would expect typical weeknight. There excuse poor service food. On top that, restrooms extremely filthy clearly stocked cleaned recently. Maybe night place, I plan going back taking chance.
The worst bar worst service area. If I could give 0 stars I would. There one positive thing I could say times Ive ever here. It added short list places I never step foot again. Please... Take hard earned money elsewhere.
Sat bar 240 Saturday appetizers drinks. Not super busy took ten minutes draft beer martini. Took 20 appetizers. No offer refill drinks water. Bartender organizing glasses drying glasses...passed us couple times eye contact despite empty glasses pushed forward. Others bar also sitting drinks, order taken, I stress full bartender busy making drinks. This second time happened location day it's NOT busy. We stick Rock Bottom Waterfront day.
I made reservation 6 Saturday night. When arrived told one waitresses didn't make reservations less six.Then changed six less. I asked speak manager told don't make reservations less ten. They record reservation. The manager rude. She asked I called right location. When I confirmed I had, apparent didn't believe me. When I told I made reservation 10 days earlier weekday afternoon spoken gentleman, told one male manager said make reservation. I told could try find something us, way tell long would take since Saturday night. We didn't stay find interest ever experiencing brand customer service again!
The food ok. We ordered pot pie soup instead given tortilla. We didn't mind much soup way spicy me, I usually like spicy food. I ordered chicken sandwich decent. Nothing rave about. It ordinary. My boyfriend ordered chicken bleu cheese flatbread, I really liked it. I'd suggest ordering come bite eat. I also tried Pinot Grigio, dirty glass. Service ok well. It wasn't really busy, steady. When walked one around door dirty tables everywhere. So made way towards back sat clean table. It seems like waitresses won't clean tables new customers sit down. After minutes, I noticed table two beside us. They us yet taken care even got drinks ordered. All all, place needs bit organization.
Valentine's Day! Terrible service. Waitress wasn't attentive would understandable extremely busy steady. Food overpriced portions. Small flies flying around restaurant. I investigated see found fly eggs hatching dirty toilet paper floor men's room near corner plunger. Mortified this, wife I quickly finished left. I'll never visit again.
I go often I work waterfront, staff friendly nice. The drinks expensive that's every Bar Louie. The one homestead takes forever food, wait ridiculous. I spent almost 45 minutes nachos. It's cool pre game dollar burgers Tuesday, dollar brews Wednesdays. It's close movie theater good date night! But make sure give little time service bit bad.
Insanely sticky floors, frozen food that's reheated microwave $10 drinks tastes like sugar water. Skip place don't want feel ill dining.
The evites mail 2 $99 special! You spend $24 parking pass. I signed last year promotion don't think I got passes worth. The waterpark nice lounging pool floating around lazy river perfect hot summer day. There many misses book though. 1st Traffic biatch! Be ready sit browns hill rd long time unless leave 9am wait park open 10am. Next remember family park lots rude bratty kids place. (I'm mean kid hater) experiences bad Sandbar pool. If arrive early enough standing hot sun gang kids WILL push way run claim 10 chairs towels even though won't use run around park day. I actually got argument last summer one said kid. I like "I'm adult need respect." He pushed took chairs. I needed one mother correct him. I fire moved chair back still giving crap I moved chairs over...THAT NO ONE even sit time. Damn! FOR REAL! Sandbar drinks expensive incredibly weak. Plus sugary. If get frozen drink sit pool prepared half pool water minutes. An Adult area would change this. I don't even care I'm getting splashed time I realize I'm pool it's hard relax. If get pass friend get days go. If you're trying go weekend forget it! The weekdays bad enough. I'm looking better pool side lounge summer.
I single good thing say restaurant. The service terrible, took 15 min get water. The nachos terrible store bought chips raw onions green peppers little meat. We ordered turkey Reuben tasted funky day old potato pancakes. We also ordered Max's famous Reuben, nothing famous it. Extremely light corn beef. Nothing special all. Will NEVER go back.
It's like back small town outside Munich... If I'd ever actually small town outside Munich! It's touristy disaster Hofbrauhaus, serve beer hefty pints like Penn Brew. Rather serve really good authentic German food, small selection imported German beer. Wunderbar!
Worst. Dinner. Ever. Food senior citizens home. Everything ready 2 seconds sat heat lamp. Avoid cost.
I've ever ordered place honestly worst German I've ever had. Goulash unidentifiable I've had, bitter flavor well. Potato pancakes taste like vinegar them. Horrendous.
Got take place weekend. Ordered kung pao chicken, steamed dumplings, pork egg rolls. I really hungry hit spot, wasn't many chicken pieces kung pao chicken - lot peanuts (as expected) whole lot celery carrots (aka filler). So I bit disappointed that. The steam dumplings good, especially fresh hot. The egg roll tasty well - I didn't find oily. Very affordable generous portion - I leftovers next day.
Followed advice fellow yelpers, gave place shot, I disappointed. My fiancé I moved area little less two years ago now, unsuccessful finding neighborhood go-to spot comes Chinese. This it! It's inexpensive tasty. Its overly salty like Chinese take tends be.
Disappointed. These guys unlimited $5 wings Tuesday, sauces great; second time I've they've run out, time 8PM, I didn't even get started! Hope get figured soon: I'm hungry!!
We stayed initially disappointed-- new town, first impression Pittsburgh bad town full homeless degenerates (the area, I find later, one worst spots city!). The hotel located across street housing authority building. Projects? UGH. Great. Then put "historical" room similar rundown cheap apartment-- old shower stall, moldy threadbare carpeting, lumpy squeaky bed. I find hour later (after freaking lo-end aspect room) new rooms recently renovated. I asked see room, ultimately change room-- fee, course. About 50% expensive. But I pay NO WAY would I able exist old "historical" creepy room. Finally, regular room-- "renovated" room similar acceptable hotel room. Why even keep historical, old, dingy, dirty room? Do figure unsuspecting people don't know better accept b/c choice?? I slept well "new" renovated room, would freaked night old room. What difference. Actually, bed linens very, comfortable. The bathroom nice clean. The room I expected hotel room be... high end four seasons, cheap nasty either. The hotel obviously availabilities new, renovated rooms, put us old, unrenovated, ugly old apartment looking room? If believed upgrading, would least gotten repeat business!! For going book here, pay new rooms, go somewhere else. The option staying old room option all. I don't think I ever go back I ever go back Pittsburgh. I stay chain hotel-- marriot whatever. What money except means comfortable live? I spend next time. Breakfast "eh". It free-- small stations fruit, cheese, small pastries, cereal, yougurt two hot items: sausage + bacon. OJ, Cranberry, Milk Coffee also available. Honestly, I felt like I college, watching pennies (poor), staying here...
Was beautiful wedding. Staff terrible, unpleasant, two slobs front desk need back people skills. Nice hotel make sure take warm bodies "people" priory cold, miserable plain miserable. I get better guest service Holiday Inn
I specific I made reservations several months ago. I needed non-entrance level room away noise. We given room right hotel Foyer. It mid-night party rages outside door even though I called front desk asking assistance. Right I would prefer Motel6. This room relatively cheap, least cut-rate given last resort. The next time I Pittsburgh include stay The Priory, shame besides issue nice place. But considering staying hotel take chance. While party continues I getting help front desk I tempted lower rating single star. But, hey, I always catch sleep tomorrow night.
booked third party site tried stick us queen room even though plenty kings available. definitely gave attitude "upgraded" anyway. wanted charge difference I refused. bad service overall. one help bags morning night. even day front desk person short us rude. I couldn't wait get there. room clean charming. area definitely rough. I wouldn't stay again.
Everything good expect housekeeping. I checked 1.5 hours came back lost clothes sweater already gone. My skirt sweater stayed together closet found skirt finally. So disappointed housekeeping!
My wife I seasoned travelers many opportunities enjoy hospitality world, high hopes Priory based reviews, short version review won't go back! The staff friendly - especially bartender preferred watch cartoon show glower guests dared interrupt TV - driver loudly complained challenge limo requests made him. The worst however room (124) - odd stains tub inhibited use, bathroom door would close completely preventing privacy, air conditioner could double white noise machine. Add breakfast lame didn't even bother second morning - stale rolls, hard boiled eggs, unripened fruit, one thing served hot - ridiculous price charged. Again, go back would discourage others staying there.
ultimate dive bar
I terrible foot pain barely walk. I told come 5 weeks. In past I seen doctor minor foot problems. Very disappointed I seen sooner. Would recommend doctor toenail trims minor problems. Do believe cares patients. Dissatisfied patient
If I could give place less one star I would. I recently bought lamp yes, pretty.. But customer service far worst I ever experienced. I known buy lamp one saleswoman extremely pushy followed around store entire time kept trying sell $400 lamp. As soon I got home I unwrapping lamp shade noticed cracked. I called immediately explained I received flawed product. They assured would order new shade would come within 7 days would call let know came in. Needless say it's two weeks one called it. I called 4 times every person I've spoken tries shuttle phone immediately without explanation. The last conversation I woman worked told "she worker couldn't help I wanted". I bought lamp hundred dollars, sent home broken lamp, told would call still haven't act like idea I am, employee tells can't help me? I would never give people money again. You find equally nice things different store better price people actually respect you.
I stopped late mother's lamp short looking replace it. I greeted nice man named Justin told bring would repair it.They parking lot saves time money looking spot. When I returned later lamp owner business looked said repairable I decided invest new one. My daughter told browse store someone would eventually join us. I saw pretty one Lenox open weave style owner came told could knock $50.00 sale price. I questioned make lamp time I asked I given reply-designer style. It would nice know whom. Can't understand big secret one. I finally opted similar lamp cost bit less Justin helped taking shelf letting compare lamps. I learn things I normally take granted. First, never use curly long lasting bulbs lamps since high quality lamps shorten life. Second, make sure rip plastic covering comes shade avoid getting burn marks it. I'm really sure true either points I kept shade original lamp home. It still plastic burn marks. Third place expensive told mark certain items daily deals. Since I need descent lamp I decided purchase less expensive one. Now rules know. Anything marked returnable. Anything buy full price may exchange within certain time frame. They sign register states inspect product leaving store. I told would take shade lamp put base box take home. After I made payment man works back came lamp wrapped plastic wrap shade still plastic wrap. There way "inspect" properly outside handling still showroom floor. Time tell whether investment paid honest customer service seemed lacking big time. I grateful Justin since helpful me. Later I found new hey, I'd sooner work reason. My daughter upset using cell phone told picture taking wasn't allowed. DUH? Since someone admonish taking pictures cell phone hand? So consider advice decide purchase here. Examine everything thoroughly.
Horrible food, horrible service. I'm really sure place manages stay business.
never problems Metro former owner. We picked company put air conditioner have. This done 12 years ago. They installed n efficient furnace 8 years ago. The service people always well trained prompt. Now seems change management changed. Service maintence seemingly priority I don't know I call problem.
I can't believe place hasn't reviewed. If thinking going know this: If grew South Hills, people high school turned real losers hanging here. (Hey, I've there, I throwing stones.) It otherwise typical South Pittsburgh yinzer bar. There always seat, free pretzels.
I hate post anything negative, seriously, place one worst. We weren't expecting top line anything,.but everything place bad. The place pretty dirty, coffee like water, waited close hour food (apparently cook decided leave 45 minutes), waitress-owner interested drinking beers another set customers (at 9:30 morning!!) checking us. The food beyond bad-oh'...and ice cold. The waitress, one time came over, literally spilled.a good amount coffee table walked back drinking buddies. It like getting shitty breakfast local sub dive bar.
Some food drink items overpriced. After waiting forever get served, food turned horrible sent back..this entire visit disappointment. No reason ever go back.
Well-kept northside secret, hidden plain sight middle patch virtual wasteland. Great breakfast half price overpriced tourist traps side 16th st bridge.
You can't go wrong Cain's. The staff friendly food great. I'm regular guest I've never disappointed. I highly recommend it.
This place another undeserving hard earned money!! The following email I sent owner, shed little light I feel way...I also share response, ultimately became situation. I know one long winded, forewarned giving money! I bar many times, I good less average experiences, past Saturday terrible! My girlfriend I came dinner around 9 pm. We knew would crowded due Penguin game, wasn't problem. When arrived, seats bar tables available anywhere. We decided beer wait. After game over, tables opened sat empty booth back waited. After 5 minutes, waitress came over, cleaned table, made notice fact still drinks. Sadly, last time ever came table. We placed closed menus end table...nothing, put empty glasses end table menus...nothing. We sat waited 15 minutes. All waiting, another group four sat table next us, never given attention. They got left completely ignored. I understand restaurant busy, service wait times may impacted, way treated (or lack treated) appalling. It especially annoying watch server initially cleaned table giggling carrying two booths appeared friends side dining room done casually walked another empty table picked something went kitchen without even taking look around dining room. At point disgusted got left, I annoyed made mention awful service back doorman. The waitresses back terrible seemed sense urgency seem care customers, exception tables interested socializing with. This seems problem, past less stellar experiences, disappointment service back servers. On occasions thing, seemed interested social butterflies providing sort service. You don't need improve wait staff, need replace them, least people working back dining room past Saturday, completely useless! Will I come back restaurant, I'm sure. The food good, I work hard money, I expect receive good food exchange it. Sincerely, Matt K. Here response I got Please give call (412)555-1212 discuss matter. I'm sorry & make every attempt make sure doesn't happen again. Thank making aware situation. Joey DeMarco I promptly called soon I got email. It went voice mail , I left message. That it, guy didn't even decency return phone call. It amazing business owners expect keep people coming doors handing hard earned money. Support local businesses, make sure deserving money!
Draft selections good...service lousy...food sub par. Not hurry return.
I ordered burger sweet potato fries, burger pink inside..not I like eat them. Our waitress initially helpful took back kitchen cook longer me. 25 minutes later date finished meal fries gone. Our waitress never returned let know going on, I ended asking box burger go thinking I would eat lunch next day. When I re-heated supposedly re-cooked burger following day still pink inside. So I sure kitchen 25 minutes cooking burger. We returning here!
Do order steak prime rib here. The prime rib, ordered rare, medium, dry extremely salty. The rib eye thinly cut, salty dry. When I told waitress, said chef said maybe I something it, like fault. I felt insulted. The bill $38.00 pricey. I disappointed would order anything wings here.
Hi there...went group five brunch today things started well. Coffee...water...good fun. Then ordered...three party received orders within 15 minutes liked food. The fourth got 30 minutes later food terrible. Cold. Greasy. Stale. The fifth, me, never received short stack pancakes eggs I ordered. Bad service wait staff manager...they checked left figure order went several times. Then they'd come back ask what's wrong forgot already tasked find order. Cain's usually good place morning dropped ball...and apparently pancakes eggs.
Came breakfast. Kim "manager" mean time walked door. We tried sit table told us big party coming. Then, sat 2 small parties there. 90 minutes later, people gotten food eaten, asked breakfast. We told would ANOTHER 15 minutes. Funny thing is, friend told horrible service mean chick front acts. We tried give benefit doubt. Bad idea. This place bad idea around. One star belongs bald bartender.
Very disappointed place. The food pretty good, I'll give that....but owner inappropriate say least. He wouldn't leave female friend alone got extremely inappropriate point forced leave bc uncomfortable never-ending inappropriateness. We never going back.
I really can't believe place still open due service food. I came 3 people us felt disrespected, ignored abused. At one point I call manager flat told shut one point. I'm adult, child, wtf thinking told shut he's lucky I didn't flip table there. Believe ever want treated like adult nice meal avoid place like plague. This place cancerous sore dormont, cancer get rid it. This place torn turned something nice supports people doesn't leave sour taste leave. This place sad.
Rude bartender, asked ID returning ID basically throw me. Also didn't seem nice. He thinks cool trying impress waitress. Very annoyed ignorant! Review base October 25.
We've number times I still don't know come back. Anything dealing food train wreck. The wait always hour more, last 4 times several people table return food cooked, cooked (burnt was). Today waiting hour half food came cold. We sent fried chicken back cold, new plate came out, hot raw center. I'm done eating here. I may come drinks, never eat. Eat risk. You've warned! If I could less star I would.
The place well put together It's priced service terrible. Tonight different night I've Cain's. An hour ordering appetizers burgers I walked waitress wasn't waiting table asked status order. One minute later food delivered cold. I think it's reasonable expect wings delivered main course I'd certainly expect food warm. It's also really expensive. A table three Cain's, spent two hours drinking waiting meal, way $100. I didn't line line break bill I'd guess place carries 20% premium bars area. Maybe worth experience enjoyable friends I usually leave frustrated walked in. It's worth money. The place great location otherwise it's waste. I'm personally finished place.
I going bars 30 years, probably rudest staff I ever seen. Will NEVER go back!
Came breakfast bf morning. Was surprised bar full. Nice atmosphere music. Waitress polite. The issue almost one half hours sitting still don't food. Asked refill coffee got cold one. Unbelievable.
The Dor-Stop crowded wait 10 minutes. Not bad Sunday morning. Waitress quick get coffee us. It take little longer would expect get meal...we started get really hungry. Ordered Eggs Benedict, pretty ordinary. Comes ordinary home fries.
Found place average best. Pancakes good. They tasted like made mix, mushy middle, came powdered sugar I don't like (wish server told beforehand). Average wait time seated food arrive. OJ pretty bad well- like cheap stuff get grocery store. I like fact place chain, I'd trying food there, experience pancakes live hype.
While Dor-Stop cute place nice tree lined street, I'm sure big fuss about. The food fair don't even real cream coffee. It's nasty fake nondairy crap. It also gave heebeegeebees due "Christianesgue" motif.
Went friend. Had egg Benedict like it. The turkey meat smells funny. And waitress kept rushing us. Not sure it's crowded. Will visit again.
I really, really wanted try Dor - Stop, wasn't open I went! My wife I woke early go there, diner closed next days, EVEN THOUGH IT DIDNT SAY THAT ON THE WEBSITE! Such waste time. If you're going go, make sure call ahead, don't get screwed like did.
Crowded serves killer breakfast...highly recommended
Was going try buffalo pizza. Tried call 9:15 pm Saturday night didn't even pick phone. They'er menu says open til 10pm Disappointed again! No longer going try.
I ordered lunch Ron's Pizza Palace staff member visited work's building promote Ron's nearby businesses. The staff member gave us menu mentioned discount could use day, coworkers I figured we'd give try. And...I pretty underwhelmed. For starters, couple people definitely problems ordering due poor connection something like that. Fine. It happens. But food eventually arrived poor deliveryman told idea much lunch cost. Fortunately, I'd gotten info I ordered. But world plan I hadn't calculated payment advance? Would I call sort staff's mistake? Would I handed guy random amount money waved off? I idea. And food certainly left lot desired. I ordered mozzarella sticks appetizer, impress me. The cheese anything gooey, I ended eating couple sticks one bite cheese simply wouldn't rip apart I bit it. The batter sticks also left pretty bad aftertaste mouth, much I chugged Coke every bite try make it. As sandwiches, coworkers complained hoagies came much mayo - one girl even asked mayo come side. No luck: came sandwich like everyone else. As me, ranch I asked go buffalo chicken hoagie didn't even arrive. I used company fridge. And ranch way I could eat sandwich, drowning buffalo sauce could taken toaster lot sooner - entire sections sandwich's bread shouldn't break I bite it, that's happens toast something badly...and happened here. I currently don't plan ordering place again. This prime example "you get pay for" - personally I'd prefer spend couple extra dollars tastier satisfying lunch.
I really don't know place got good reviews. One big problem place dirty, carpets, lighting tables furniture. I tried place 5 times past 2 years went. The 1st time I burger tasted funny I didn't finish it. I got food poisoning sick. This I thought might stomach flu I try place again. The 2nd time I friends neighborhood 3/5 us spaghetti meatballs got food poisoning.Now I'm thinking hygiene problem ground meat. I going stay away place friend Troy hill liked stop close home. No problem,next time I got french fries gravy. How could problem?.When got table put cold canned gravy fries.When I told waitress took back kitchen microwaved till heat lava. Needless say I refused pay them. The 4th time friend dragged there, I salad. I didn't get sick wasn't anything special bagged salad mix couple ripe tomato pieces cucumber. The last time I got slice pie good. I longer go Billy's, dear friend passed away I refuse go anywhere near place. To owner-Please sell restaurant, obviously don't care place know handle food safely.
A trip Omnimax Theater always good time I never left disappointed. The theater massive screen something like 5 times regular movie screen it's way bigger IMAX. Did know ever Christmas season Omnimax screens Polar Express! I mean guys really feel like you're riding train! Seeing Polar Express annually become something family tradition little ones. And cool Batman Dark Knight Raises also screened here? The massive screen added layer epic film viewing experience way could matched theater around town. Tickets movies Omnimax purchased separately general admission pass museum. I recall ticket prices shows $9-$12.00. Bonus it's set like movie theater accompanied concession stand serves ICEEs. I would suggest little kids 5 , sound loud prove frightening whelming. I learned hard way.
In making places I visit going Pittsburgh Carnegie Museum make list. With many hours spent adjacent library museum really way I could make time I visit. I sure seemed like ominous dinosaur skeletons still either way walk memory lane go.
How put gently? While I may go back Pittsburgh day, I never return Carnegie Museum Art. It's I mind gallery seemed small compared others I viewed (sometimes small museums hidden treasures) one whole gallery blown glass I felt like I bong shop haight st. sf. It comes fact docent, trying explain painting watchtower it, told students watchtower "from Auschwitz, place basically fried lot Jews". Seriously? That's chose describe concentration camps large class I could guess middle schoolers? It sounded like described bad breakfast joint..."oh place? basically fry eggs". On top that, description piece stated watchtower reminiscent spread throughout East West Germany Hitler's rule (i.e. Auschwitz). In sum, docents reflection institution volunteer, one sucked. So, Carnegie Museums Pittsburgh, you're going hire racist people lead tours, least make sure facts straight (or read).
never forget day found archaeological "elevator" doesn't REALLY go half-million feet ground. don't want dramatic, but, yeah - never same.
So hype I expecting fireworks. Maybe I tainted. When come California food fresh, sometimes disappointed, one times. My son watches, triple d, excited here, best ok. No fireworks. I veggie burrito, one son egg burrito, son egg breakfast. I ordered side bacon also. My waitress brought three scoops sour cream, little white contains, soggy say least. My burrito, good; kids food ok, eggs terrible bacon, Terrible. I love bacon love it, bacon cheap tasting tasted like girdle. Gross... Sorry Dor-stop. If every Folsom Cali try Mary's gold miner cafe. The bomb!
To start simply, let's say I low expectations. I mean, really I stopped something rainy day Pittsburgh work ( I mean work done I swear). So I stopped see museums about, I surprised see magnitude serious works have, diversity collection, oh dinosaurs. Two museums price one really bargain, there's way see that. The collections BOTH museums interesting vast. Different people different ways experiencing museums, personally I like meander find different things different times. I glad see I could definitely get lost different ways different occasions. But review art dinosaurs (natural history) really going cover everything space offer, I'll say won't disappointed, knows maybe you'll really love it. I know I did.
Pancakes, pancakes, pancakes. Everybody told I HAD try pancakes. Well, short stack served lousy pancakes.
At point, I done. I scheduled kids last 2 weeks August due emergency, I cancel, I month camp start. I told issuing refund, 3 weeks ago. THREE WEEKS still dont it. I live probably 30 minutes museum could driven 63838484848485858 times picked up. Its sooo unprofessional annoying. They need get office together deliver refunds timely manner. 7-10 business days fine 3 WEEKS UNACCEPTABLE even MAILED YET. So dissapointed never use again.
In response response I received Museum rep, I called left message never received reply yet, reponded Yelp. This week 3rd week. response stated refund sent week, speaking current week, today 14th, monday week begun. If talking last week, please tell day since leaving messages gain response except contacted Yelp. Thank you.
Believe not, I planning review Pittsburgh landmark big news Warren Buffett's billions buying Heinz. Dear Warren Buffett, don't mess ketchup! FACT: Heinz Ketchup used 93% restaurants, nation wide! The HJ Heinz company formed 1869 Henry John Heinz sold mother's canned horseradish door door. Today Heinz's headquarters still Pittsburgh, although products made Pittsburgh anymore. The plant base Troy Hill near Allegheny river sold Treehouse Foods make private label soups. I'll never forget going factory Cub Scout vinegar smelled toured factory. We got full size bottle Ketchup take home us, course Pickle Pin, one iconic symbols associated Heinz. Again, Mr Buffett, don't mess red stuff whole gaggle Terrible Towel waving Yinzers open whoop ass ya!
Pizza hut fucking OWNS!
Estimated delivery time 45 minutes actually delivery time 120 minutes. Pizza Hut , pizza last resort.
This worst location. Orders consistently incorrect rarely time. Asked refund due order even made 20 min
After reading horrible reviews, I made mistake still ordering place. Order placed 6:12 pm, delivered 7:36pm. Order was: 1. Cold 2. Ordered 2 medium pizzas, THIN crust, one pepperoni, one premium salami...I received regular crust one sausage. Called store, told Mgr. problem said, I quote " problem driver took wrong pizzas" shit genius. His remedy driver go back pick deliver me...really?
First last order. Two hours I'm still waiting slow Sunday night. Indian call center said order cancelled, local store said delivery--45 minutes ago. Tick, tick, tick...Store less mile away. Made 2nd call. This time admit he's left 20 minutes ago. Unapologetic pitiful. Now it's closing time I can't answer phone cancel.
order place! really bad service!
Food ok Horrible delivery service. They called wrong number despite given right one. Hence didn't deliver food called ask can't pick food said closed can't carry well. Horrible horrible service.
So restaurant BYOB instant star opinion even weird strip club-esque name (Legends, though? Come guys). So one friends fellow yelper lives hood decided bundle-up, wine-up snowy friday night head Legends. The interior retro I expecting, extremely cozy. The menu pretty standard rotating specials. I decided chicken cacciatore. Big portion. No pasta. Potato veggies. I stuffed!! Besides BYOBs, I also weakness restaurants walkable. Check. PROS: BYOB, Friendly servers, open kitchen, large menu small place, WALKABLE. CONS: Lame Corkage fees, could use interior face lift. Overall: This stable friend's restaurant rotation I sure I back sooner rather later! I curious place new development Northside. I hope helps them!
I get hype behind place. I 3 times thing I would recommend pancakes. I stuck pancakes last visit I went meatloaf sandwich instead. It average didn't really taste. It came mashed potatoes definitely package. I always wondered place didn't stay open later I see why, everything isn't pancake failure. The worst part last visit service. We arrived place half empty seated table. The waitress kind like want, I don't expect every place trader joe's type happy don't act like bothering coming here. She took order last saw her. Someone else brought food one ever came back check us. I could see waitress go table (she 2 tables) check multiple times. We didn't get refills drinks every time I tried motion would turn back sit counter talk waitress. We never even received check go counter ask self. We told wait needed check someone else first. After standing couple minutes given check. No apologies anything. I won't back.
After scouring Internet best breakfast joint Pittsburgh, I landed Dor-Stop. Why I always believe place featured DDD, must incredible? I ordered Guy's version breakfast jumbot, I mood something spicy side. My waitress confirmed order verbally. I received regular jumbot instead, didn't say anything I tight schedule plane catch. I disappointed lack flavor/seasoning meal. It consisted scrambled eggs, ham, bell peppers, type cheese (tasted artificial powder-based). The eggs wetter I prefer I order scrambled. Maybe added water? Several pieces ham I ate gristly inedible. I ate less half meal left. I wouldn't go back.
Had steak n' eggs went there. I prefer thing diner around corner. Apparently place known pancakes. Maybe I'll try next time. A consisteny line yinzers around block can't wrong.
legends losing star. closed lunch Saturdays! that?
Local call place Camps short. If u like thin crust pizza , place . Try bacon pizza .. It's fantastic . Cash place
grew camps....best sausage toppings area....hoagies also tasty
Watch cold table pit In spite requesting move, told tables booked.Of course true. Prices inflated limited valentines Day Menu. I many times past, raved friends. Never again, list.
Great dinner - hidden gem lunch! Try chicken parm sandwich. Mama's gravy ...enough said!
Quality taken nosedive since changing hands. Nothing good was. Now it's crap.
everything could want pizzeria. I recommend pizza boats, get week always cooked perfection.
Thinking car inspection brings fear core me! That little sticker left hand side car stares year. I know fear starts setting around June (July I'm due). My brakes squeaky. The car sounds like death turn engine on. You know....the endless scenarios go head drives crazy (haha, get it?!)! You could probably go crazy finding garage that's going shady give long list things need "fixed." That's it's finally nice find place straight needs fixed (or sometimes maybe nothing all...score!). Plus don't charge small fortune labor. I understand labor dirty job...but please....child labor also dirty job women don't get charge that! The two really awesome things I've noticed they're incredibly quick fixing car. You usually call day car breaking still get looked day, day after. The thing look around cheapest parts fix car with. I appreciate fellow "discount" shopper. Although may shopping things...we're still value! So even though I fear end June....I don't fear actual mechanic now!
Love "cozy" atmosphere. They keep simple food delicious. I've gone times great service time. Only complaint prices rather expensive basics, especially since portions smaller side ($18 small bowl alfredo little chicken).
Legends old style American-Italian restaurant. The restaurant small problem managing customers. People came reservations waited least 20 minutes get seated tables. Other people walked-in seated immediately promise "to eat less hour" I guess reservations people table want get customers anyway. I able witness I seated bar table cashier/host. The food less average. I tried 3 different orders + desserts, nothing impressing.
You know it's bad get car practically tears bad haircut is. Having curly hair, I've fair share terrible haircuts. The one I salon among worst. I explained owner salon I wanted layering, apparently I didn't tell exactly cut hair - since all, I figured he's one know cut hair, including curly hair - it's fault I received terrible haircut. Sorry, I guess I busy watching horror blunt cut horizontal layers hair (exactly opposite you're supposed curly hair). The owner clearly idea cut curly hair. And he's overpriced boot. The stylists may give better cuts, owner's attitude ("It's fault") suggests salon deserves one's business.
Short getting hands knees begging stylist cut ONE HALF INCH, I don't know else I could done.. Before every haircut I explain I particular length hair -- I want keep long, grows slowly, IMPERATIVE cut TINY AMOUNT off, etc, etc. I made extremely clear stylist. She promised "wouldn't anything crazy.." Let's say I using cathartic outlet experience I went trim left FOUR INCHES missing hair. I'm still recovering aesthetically emotionally trauma! It doesn't make sense stylist would exactly opposite requested. I think maybe used cutting children's hair listening them. But either way, really quick/easy trim, turned one extreme haircuts life. It could easily avoided. It doesn't feel fair. Proceed caution..
My mistake I went Namaste India cousin. Pappad served beginning moment could afford smile! Rest complete disaster.. We ordered aloo tikki "much recommended" samosa Chaat!! Samosa chaat cold touch- looked like heap poorly cooked samosa.. worse RED CHILLI powder used garnishing ( asked bit spicy- fault) ..that plenty... could used amount red chiili powder cooking food 6-7 people!! Taste average... could barely think ordering main course initial encounter.. Malai kofta ordered besides daal... Malai Kofta looked like stuffed samosa!! ( Pun intended) ... bland tasteless.. NAAN good ..thin , baked properly...out consolation... No wonder left half ordered dishes... Worth mentioning fact that..Kohli's store adjacent saw samosas there..I wonder ones namaste part deal? Please beware place- may end cursing visit later on... right now...
I impressed. The food so-so boyfriend I coupon purchased morning restaurants.com wouldn't accept it. I bought morning, sorry taken website honor it. I would pay full price it, nice coupon maybe could worth it. The quality food good enough outweigh service.
Namaste best Indian food area, it's closest house, go lunch buffet, I rate good, great. They almost always Indian buffet staple, channa masala, maybe 2 3 veggie dishes, couple meat selections, lamb curry chicken tikka masala, cold salad bar lettuce raw veggies, pickles, chaat masala raita. If arrive early items buffet, bring table, nice. Dessert almost always gulab jamun chai tea, help to. On couple visits, tandoor chicken wings, die for, aren't always available. I would rated place 4 stars, inconsistent visit visit.
My go-to Indian buffet South hills simple, non-pretentious Indian buffet food. My prior fave Billu's recently CLOSED. : ( Namaste run family Sikh Indian folks friendly accomodating. This Indian food gourmet level somewhere like Tamarind The Mintt it's good enough govt. work saying goes .
I excited try place since closure Maharaja left us without good Indian buffet side Pittsburgh I live, I wasn't crazy restaurant moved afterward. The place relatively deserted Saturday afternoon soon greeted woman asked us kind naan wanted (onion plain). The food tasted fairly good really turned us woman worked constant coughing, hacking wheezing without even covering mouth! Clearly nasty cold should've stayed home day! I cringed every time went back kitchen (we could back hacking lung) came table. It unappetizing hardly ate anything got soon possible. I don't think I go back given low standard hygiene. Ick, I'm cringing right thinking it. On plus side though, keep overeating. Maybe I husband cough hack whenever go buffets on! Anyway, I hate trash restaurant I voice concerns. I conflicted giving second star, food wasn't bad. Try risk!
This probably one worst places I've eaten . I'm sure worse food service . Never , coupon bought weren't allowed use left table
Hard complain much $7 buffet. Food wasn't bad, I've certainly worse Indian Pittsburgh. Limited selection don't refill often enough. Odd atmosphere, need background music something. The soap opera tv didn't cut it. They give fresh naan bread nice, old buffet naan always sucks. Good you're area need cheap lunch worth going way for.
I wish I could give place "-5" stars terrible food quality. Oily, greasy bad taste. All 4 members party fell sick, throwing and/or running stomach.
Lunch time...we opted menu vs. buffet family's first time indian...I ordered them, knowing would like. My issues: Holy Sh!t expensive lunch!!!! The old woman NOT nice. AT ALL. Gobi Manchurian appetizer small 12.50! what????? however, perhaps best I've ever tasted...I refuse ever pay ever portion. Crazy. In addition, entree $11-$12 came rice. I paid $2.50 additional order naan. Also crazy. That said...for 4 people, lunch tab came $70. SEVENTY DOLLARS. For appetizer, 4 entrees, naan. No drinks. So, I never back. Which sad, really. However....the food damn good. We chicken vindaloo, good spicy, chicken tikka masala, mild good sweet taste. Hey Namaste....hit ever work prices customer service....I'll give another go. Until then, I sticking Cafe Dahli.
I wish I could give 0 stars...total waste money. Food bad I threw trash. Hope one falls sick eating food here.
Food terrible. tasted like old food. Hope one falls sick eating food here.
My daughter I used eat location Mahajara, really liked. We wanted give place try. Firstly, lady wasn't hospitable host big deal, hoping food would make it. The buffet unimpressive selections, much choose all. Also food bland pretty much flavorless, disappointing. To make experience even worse, daughter experienced allergic reaction (she nut allergy).. No clue consumed buffet cause I suppose inquired ingredients food prep, though never reaction Indian buffets different restaurants past. I ended getting Med Express 51 time treated epinephrine, steroid benydryl via IV.. Terrifying experience I wanted make sure I posted alert future customers similar allergies since viewable signage let consumers know beware! Needless say, never return!
Severely disappointed. I ordered chicken curry. Lacking flavor, "curry", spicy ever, little lacking protein portion, I ended cooking night I didn't want to. I fixed "curry" sauce adding curry.... Don't afraid flavor ever cooking here.
The atmosphere place leave something desired, I always left relatively satisfied. The food isn't quite good India Garden, buffet selection bigger, it's less expensive. With Indian food, I eat bread meat dishes, usually 4 meat selections: chicken curry, chicken cream sauce, grilled chicken spice, 4th varies. Overall, worth stop neighborhood.
The hotel little listing Maharaja includes pretty specific weird hours, none include Mondays. I called Monday confirm got dude saying close 9ish. I showed menu states pretty simply, 11am - 10pm 7 days week.. Buffet closes 9:30. They didn't speak about, point even half heartedly gesture menu. I immediately pointed buffet told "have whatever want" something similar. There 6 veg options, 4 meats (biryanis curries), nan, poori bhajis, kheer pleasantly hot gulab jamun, average (free, unlimited) lassi, good chai, decent chutneys lemon pickles. Meals ends mukhwa, candy plain fennel seeds kept seperate bowls. The emphasis customer self-reliance could construed bad lazy service, I appreciate lax environment.
Terrible place eat clean all. Way priced foe fast food. 5$ plain roast beef forget that!
I actually don't mind Arby's chain; I certainly don't go one regular basis, I I usually enjoy treat so-not-good-for-me fast food type sandwich side curly fries. Usually I get Arby's a-ok fast food variety sandwich that, greasy, still tasty doesn't leave feeling sick stomach. That said, I never truly enjoy food I pick particular Arby's. Firstly, often I've placed order drive-thru I've found I've sit wait "fast food" 10 15 minutes. After waiting food - days I didn't leave line frustration placing order I couldn't even reasonable amount time - I've found I've gotten mediocre compared I've experienced Arby's. Common issues I've come across include lack sauces I've asked them, overcooked food, much grease sandwich begins coming apart, AND eating I begin feel sick stomach. Sorry, guys. I may expect lot fast food joint, Arby's doesn't impress me.
I desperately hungry late one night options. I ordered crispy chicken sandwich meal I food poisoning. My guess suspect sauce put sandwich. Or maybe fact Arby's. Why don't us favor set place fire collect insurance money way.
I waited order 10 minutes. I ordered two chicken finger kids meals two adult meals. Had pull forward wait another ten minutes food. When I got home didn't give kids meals.
It's IGA now.
Meh. At best. So I went Bado's tonight w/ dad sister bit lackluster. I started chicken noodle soup (w/ noodles) spicy bloody ( I know. I know. I avid evening bloody mary drinker.) The bloody mary pretty awesome I assume pre-made mix. I also got grilled swordfish salad bland hell! Iceberg lettuce, croutons, cucumbers, dry swordfish. Lame. My dad got meatball casserole something I would never ordered...meatballs casserole aren't selling point me, let alone package deal. This meatball casserole dish pasta meatballs...thankfully dads heart. My sister got salad (again iceberg lettuce, croutons, cucumbers) chicken fingers. She also split small mushroom pizza dad average. I guess pizza Bados known stick go. Pro: Spicy bloody marys, decent pizza, cute waiter, wide beer selection Con: bland salads, noodleless noodle soups, many healthy options, dinner entrees besides pasta,
Just got pittsburgh style sandwich " steak" garbage , bread moldy. I gave place second chance failed. Gross.never again!
Hostess awkward seating us. Sat us corner small booth broken seat right another large party. The place means busy. We sat waited someone acknowledge us. We watched 4 members wait staff attend 4 tables one ever acknowledged us came over. After 15 minutes ignored staff, got walked out. It's shame too... liked looks menu bar list specials. Don't think we'd ever come back that. There plenty places.
Consumer Beware !!!! This place joke! We party thirty heard good things establishment. The food average best (Same pizza Cici's pizza far taste) We payed little shy 1000.00$ two half large pizzas, small pan overcooked wings, Two loaves bread balogna ham called hoagie, small salad. Thank goodness beer wine(at extra cost) us drink two televisions watch football game on(But wouldnt turn sound on) . They told us eat buffet guest (most 60) wings salad gone would replinish "An extra phenominal fee" . The people wanted enjoy cup coffee also told sorry,, That also "Additional Cost"!! The money isnt issue would front honest us. We TERRIBLE experience unfortunately NEVER step foot place again. And top things off,, The pizza two called hoagies left over(because bread) payed for, We told could take home someone might get sick. Im sorry, But I didnt pay feed staff dinner !!!!! On good note, The bartender great guy good job.
I want like due location great beer selection, food awful.
one worst steak sandwiches i've ever eaten. 7 us people liked food kids one pizza. would never eat
Everything basic large price tag. You small pizza (literally like kids size) 10 bucks (it's like 4 bites). Not mention add topping two, it's 15 bucks. Their wings make home better. Swordfish salad wasn't cooked right (they probably shouldn't serving don't top chefs). Lastly, I also overcharged everything- added things bill I order eat. Maybe people would pay bill without looking first, I smart enough get scammed sadly mistaken stupidity. Just fyi them, I didn't plan paying 2 random tables full random people, addition bill. Weird.
We ate Friday night whole experience disaster. Rude, unfriendly, miserable male server. Drinks lousy , service lousy, food o.k., nothing write home about, 9:00 Friday night putting chairs tables vacuuming, hinting time us leave. The whole experince horrible... bill outrageous. Save money Go somewhere else!!!!
I never go back. Besides gnocchi coming vacuum sealed bag, offer " Pittsburgh Sandwich " don't know make. Served fries side bagged coleslaw. Fries afterthought due pickle found underneath. watched young waiter spill two drinks, e customer. Same waiter avoiding table cash payment, waiting leave could pocket change, finally got change, soon left pulled wallet put tip inside.So unprofessional. Food box trained staff. Not begged would I go back.
Very disappointed delivery order evening. The potato soup runny, looked like milky water potatoes it. The wedding soup less fair. Thee Buffalo chicken sandwich lettuce tomato it. The Reuben fries soggy greasy. The chicken salad, lettuce wilted, although chicken strips best thing whole order. The turkey grilled sandwich also lettuce tomato greasy soggy come chips pickles listed menu. For charged this. It disgrace . We order pass word around. There many decent less expensive delivery restaurants ever order again. Disappointed.
Margarita pizza - best fucking pizza I've ever ate! End story. On commute home work; eating one weekly. Just 8 12 pieces. Time power nap (8 hours) wake up, bake up, go work. If don't order pizza...you fucking suck.
We really wonderful experiences place along really terrible ones. The plain pizza order never seems taste same. I ordered burger twice came different great second time. The fries ways soggy cold. We would keep ordering knew could paying expected. I want badly like place!!
Update: Chef Dan read review (below) kind enough refund meal. As stated original review I sent meal back right away, part me. Great quality customer service. When I go probably half-dozen times year past several years. I usually order Beans Greens. This past Friday evening I something different, I ordered special sounded divine. Blackened ahi tuna two different kinds ravioli asparagus mushrooms topped artichoke hearts covered cream sauce. Well dish arrived I thought dinner companion's meal I saw first ravioli. My friend confused well thought fish, tuna replaced salmon, unripe tomato. It fact smallest piece salmon I ever served restaurant barring piece salmon sushi. My friend joked maybe I wearing kimono jacket thought I want bonsai salmon. Now I blame sending back, I done. Now gets worse. The bill comes, dish $36. Sticker shock disappointment say least. Given entrees Legend's $18-25 range I thought high-end range would price special. Ah well Legend's I return I go back Beans Greens. If go tempted order special, ask price.
Been times. Decent place always rates 3-4 stars
We waited forever. Our food wasn't prepared properly (my husband's salmon wasn't cooked well like asked. He sent back literally threw microwave, heating plate leaving inside still cooked through...). Our server overwhelmed (after Steelers Game, still... used location) Giving 2-star salad ok, that's it. Definitely coming back.
So, daughter, father I visited SoHo playing Science Center, Sunday evening. The restaurant two customers dining room ourselves. The vibe chill server awesome. He took time us put extra detail accommodating little munchkin. I ordered Pittsburgher Chicken Salad decent, nothing write home about. My significant ordered Meatloaf feature. His food looked dry inedible. He's type complain food server, I am. So server took food away tasted horrible looking good encouraged order something different. So ordered fish sandwich. It pretty decent however could tell frozen fish. Are expectations high? How hard could dip piece fish batter fry it. I disappointed lack freshness. The chicken breasts salad square mechanically processed strips too. Well, I don't see reason go back there. Unless, I server, refreshing. Service isn't used be. Needless say, "aite", nothing amazing.
salads quite exceptional, especially philly muscles buttery goodness sushi good, don't care woman eats everyday cuz lives across street says think put mayo sushi, - however authentic - disgusting
I got slow roasted jerk chicken (yes I know fish market!) good. For dessert I split 'doughnut' ice cream tasty.
From March 2013 visit: food much better, good enough I want return. I salmon, quinoa, spinach, pesto, bread (that's I remember). I'm upgrading 4 stars. From Aug. 2009: The disappointing thing place temperature: uncomfortably cold. Probably 60 degrees (on warm day August!). The whole dining area cold; wasn't table. When brought attention waiter said there's nothing it; it's hotel's cooling system. That's insane! Don't care comfort customers? The food good, waiter poor job: got one order correct, botched Jo's fish dish (she asked rice pilaf without tomato, brought standard rice pilaf tomato), botched order (I didn't order prix fixe dinner, charged (at cost $7 more), even though I communicated order clearly.
Huge salad served small plate? Horrible drink (old Fashioned)? Spaghetti--huge amount, taste? Noise level--painful? Why I never return?
The service good, location great...but pizza really good all. We two pizzas: meat-lovers veggie, traditional crust. The crust extremely bland, toppings sauce pretty sparse, simply flavor. I'm really hesitant post poor reviews, getting around it: pizza really bad standard.
Had gnocchi delivered. Absolutely terrible. Gnocci's 2 years old. Delivery guy shady too.
I don't like place all. The staff always rude sense care business. A couple years ago I heard smoke making pizza. All employees tend shady. I don't recommend all.
Under new ownership I thought I'd give shot. Tried order using coupon website, refused honor offered coupon. No apology explanation, bad attitude. Not great first impression.
I wish negative stars I could put place. One unprofessional experiences I ever business owner, even worker. I yelled at, mocked, generally treated like crap checking remounting job supposed done within week. Emotional mess rest day. I never treated way owner business. I work restaurant owners god's sake! Unbelievable. If want full story, email I tell whole thing. As right now, DO NOT patronize business. There absolutely excuse attitude.
So incredibly disappointed 'service' I received Blooming Dahlia last month!! I actually felt sick stomach leaving store florist (who I believe owner) nasty... basically kicking out, waving goodbye one hand (as quaking like duck!) rudely blurting "bye, bye" mean tone!... front 17 year old daughter actually shocked florist's behavior. Are kidding me?!?! I pre-ordered presentation bouquet days prior 12 year old performing lead role Nutcracker Sunday... one dozen esperanza roses $4 each. I went Blooming Dahlia I wanted something extra special bouquet would presented onstage bows. Though bouquet ready older daughter I stopped store Saturday performances, I complain. When I noticed florist wrapping roses light brown tissue paper (that actually looked like brown paper bag), I asked pink white tissue paper could use instead. The florist visibly annoyed request look see colors (which not). Okay, I thought, I simply rewrap roses pretty tissue paper I get home. But, started ringing order $5 per rose (versus original quote $4 each), I decided purchase bouquet. Why would I pay high price roses nice certainly extra special I would go home unwrap rewrap tissue paper?! I actually apologized said thank you, I decided purchase bouquet (which, way, still completely arranged wrapped). She looked asked, "so taking bouquet?" I replied, "no, I'm sorry. It's I looking for, thank you". And that's rudely waved daughter shop. Needless say, I NOT returning Blooming Dahlia... I NOT hesitate share unfortunate experience others. There plenty good florists South Hills...
Does honor National Sub Day offer. They tell JUST pay. Too late back out. WTF?
Awful. I didn't know bad I went different GE saw good could be. The lines long, produce selection minimal, store overcrowded. The last straw yesterday cashier blew nose, stuck kleenex nose, put back pocket continued scan groceries. When I complained manager, denied employees sick. I'm done shopping store.
Absolutely wretched incompetent billing department. Overcharged four months row, called every month repeatedly told would fixed. I went American Express file dispute least able reverse four overcharges. Even that, I randomly charged system upgrade never happened. I considering filing complaint better business bureau attorney general.
This Giant Eagle maybe worst supermarket I've ever to. There thugs hanging entrance parking lot. The interior dark dank outdated "made 70s" feel. With options like I don't problem taking extra time drive Trader Joe's.
Scariest/shadiest grocery store experience life. Hubby I pulled see cars down, people selling who-knows-what car trunk. Also Giant Eagle tht gives really hard time ever forget advantage card give phone instead (it works ones fine). Then leave waiting really dazed/swaying woman finish wandering around back forth front us, pass drive-by fat cash exchange (drugs?) way parking lot. We definitely scared return, never need grapes (or groceries) desperately again.
If I could leave ADT Security negative review I would. This worst company far billing & customer service concerned. I work General Contractor West Coast use ADT clients. Security patrol standard, problem invoices obscure point insensible, referencing 3 invoices never received. The way view invoices login website password one has, letter mailed jobsite. I AM NOT AT THE JOBSITE WHERE CONSTRUCTION IS DONE, I business office pay bills. Their CSRs put hold 10-15 minutes time tell lies do, call back deal lies uncovered. They worst company, favor stay away them.
The store reeks rotting fish, security guards watch like hawk food selection worse I've seen Giant Eagle city. One plus must shop plenty jitney drivers waiting come offer ride. That big help like don't car. "Need car" haha things living hood never change. With closet G E Downtown PNC Park Heinz field I would think would renovate it's years still change.
Awful customer service, tell one price COMPLETELY enough security cover small house...., charge ton actually secure house.... Only telling AFTER installed (holes wall keypad drilling ceiling smoke detector). try cancel takes forever THEY ARE RUDE!!! My advice ...... DONT USE ADT!!!!!!! Save money give honest company awful one!!!
Awful. Worst grocery store I've ever to. To make worse, supposed open 7. At 7:10, I told "still getting ready open" I come back "around 7:30"
The store weird rotting meat smell sometimes. The selection isn't amazing interesting items here. As people commented always people hanging around outside.... But friendly least me! One thing I like store proximity house. The biggest let sky high prices I think GE notorious for... I miss Kroger
Cons: * Very cramped space, aisles narrow carry case sideways. * Only items priced signs hanging them. * No shopping carts. Pros: * Decent selection * Chilled section
The hot dogs somewhat disappointing beer slightly overpriced, come sheer selection beers. An enormous beer cave makes one feel like kid beer store. Unfortunately, cheaper domestic/import selection refrigerated, really sucks cause can't drink beers find int beer cave right away. Still, you're looking selection, place.
I come veggies dogs. My husband comes beer cave. The beer bit expensive (compared buying stores NY). But you're craving favorite difficult find crazy PA licquor laws, place. This place family group friendly, sometimes might wait.
Oh shoot me! I thought seafood pizza really good mussels. The service decent boot. The thing I hated dessert.
The lobster roll world
I never Roland's today first last time! My boyfriend's family I (a party 6 baby) asked seated. There wait told us could go upstairs patio first come first serve manager setting us table highchair. No didn't! We pulled together tables hour us arriving restaurant go get highchair. We ordered food drinks right away. While I ordering I asked waitress I could white sauce instead red sauce specialty pizza. The waitresses response "No, I don't think would good." Oh, I sorry paying customer asking meal thought would good. Out 6 us, 5 people got pizzas 1 person got fish sandwich. The fish sandwich arrived nearly 20 minutes rest meals. We never offered refills drinks silverware requested multiple times. The service horrible, atmosphere chaotic uncomfortable, food horrible.
Having read positive things OFM lately, I thought we'd give another try it's years since we've eaten there. Unfortunately, experience dreadful. I knew going food overpriced. Always been. But get less expensive fish/seafood elsewhere, also get FRESHER food places. Our food tasted frozen overcooked. What NOT changed extremely poor service. If don't look wealthy you're buying multiples rounds alcohol, wait staff avoids you. And experience night. How restaurants get away poor service bland food high prices? I guess OFM lives travelers locals.
Serviceable "upscale" chain seafood spot, traditional dishes sushi. Yes, it's expensive, it's one spots open late downtown. The sashimi pleasant, it's hard screw oysters seafood pasta. Our meal basically met admittedly low expectations. The service par local crap-on-the-wall chain restaurant, don't expect much.
Hotel restaurants awful! It's like mediocre restaurant inside hotel. I don't get it! Wouldn't WANT stay spend money property?? Nevertheless, place Westin hotel different. For starters, place sorely outdated. The decorations look like they're straight 80's music video. I went mom, asked glass sculptures ceiling Chihuly's. I almost choked bread asked! I always go sushi it's menu fish place. I can't get away it, plus I need weekly (or sometimes daily) fill it! So I ordered spicy yellow tail roll ginger salad. The spicy yellow tail spicy. It side "spicy" sauce. I'm sure qualifies spicy dab sauce. The salad's ginger dressing awful watery. I love ginger dressing it's done right. But happening place! The thing really made mad place overpriced begin with. My tiny yellow tail roll expensive ($7) fabu Penn Ave Fish Co ($5.50) rolls. And DEF good! My mom ordered bowl fish soup. This "bowl" deep dish salad bowl looked small ladle size serving. It hardly halfway full. That's mom ordered lunch. It pretty sad looking. So asked little server. The server said that's could give restaurant policy. Now let tell you....I've worked restaurants. I've witnessed people eat ENTIRE meal, say bad want another one...and get another one! Now that's messed up! Asking little soup, that's supposed BOWL looks like spoonful hardly much ask for. Needless say, I NOT back. There WAY better fish places city fill belly with, hands down! Go Penn Ave Fish Co, It's opened new location right Fifth Ave! Don't say I didn't warn you!
Terrible. I visited restaurant first time yesterday use Groupon. Thank God I didn't pay full price slop. First, lets talk decor. Others commented outdated 80s look place. I concur. The chairs ridiculously heavy uncomfortable. And don't even get started hideous glass constructions hanging ceiling. Second, let talk staff. Unprofessional say least. When waiting table, I witnessed hostess yell man across restaurant, instead walking guiding party. "Hey Anthony, party's here!" Ridiculous. This restaurant open kitchen, usually good thing - everyone's yelling other. We seated near kitchen and, I'm exaggerating, heard someone yell "order!" approximately every 30 seconds. Staff yelled across restaurant constantly. I felt like I playground. Our waitress nice, sweet girl, best could considering environment in. I complaints her. The food, though... Jesus. We started "margarita shrimp cocktail". Imagine tiny round pieces popcorn shrimp floating glass lime flavored water. These served tortilla chips, you'd think meant used scoop shrimp glass. But, shrimp solid round balls, scoopable salsa. We tried picking shrimp chips, they'd roll end floor. My date I laughed TRIED eat concoction. When finally made mouths, gross anyway. My boyfriend ordered sushi/sashimi combo platter. I'm generous giving rating mediocre. Take sushi grocery store better. Now, I admit, I made mistake - I ordered fried fish platter. I'm used getting variety seafood restaurants. At place like Mitchell's Fish Market, get dish piece fish, scallops, shrimp, vegetable. The Original Fish Market dish. The dish I could get one piece fish plain steamed white rice steamed spinach, fried fish platter. So, I ordered that, side green beans (vegetables $5 - $7 extra). The description said I would get piece tilapia, scallops, oysters, shrimp, french fries. I didn't realize meant tilapia fried, scallops fried, oysters fried, shrimp fried, top giant bed fried french fries. It's I pictured. Like I said, mistake reading carefully asking waitress, lets say argument's sake I wanted. It still disgusting. The batter/flavor exactly everything. The scallops tasted like french fries. The shrimp tasted like french fries, tilapia tasted like french fries. I didn't even try oysters, I'm pretty sure would tasted like french fries. I ate barely quarter dish, I'm pretty sure I consumed entire week's worth saturated fat. If ate entire plate, I think heart attack would interrupt dessert. The green beans good. Other people commented can't count hotel restaurants worthwhile. I agree. If everyone's passing through, don't worry actually impressing anyone getting come back. And business travelers, they're usually paying company's dime, don't bother complain expect much. I learned lesson. I'm coming back. And I seriously question sanity people gave place two stars.
I eaten several times. This overpriced overhyped seafood restaurant. The portions worth price. The Sushi average best. The service poor almost every time I went. We complained manager middle talking picked phone totally forgot talking us. The salads small nothing write about. The decor needs updated. If ask I keep going back; it's choice. Usually several people staying Westin.
Came drinks conference could get service. Finally went searching someone, came back order nearly given up. And refills water, coffee soda? Forget it.
Pittsburgh good food. Don't waste time Fish Market. I stay Westin often three meals spot past week. The first fine enough get come back second trip. The second time, waitress clearly hurry serve three-person group 50% occupied restaurant. The third time, chef's special "coriander-crusted fluke" came couple slabs tasteless fish coated bread crumbs oil tossed onto pile dry couscous, served wrong salad. Service: staff don't seem respond well ordinary social cues. For instance, standing podium two minutes probably means I want seated, looked ignored two different waitresses. Or, I go bar order takeout, I submit order wait server tell wait time, I don't expect leave start washing dishes. I may stay Westin, I exert extra effort NOT eat there.
100 dollars 2 people. 2 small cups lukewarm soup, 1 tuna sushimi, 2 waters 1 seafood pasta, 1 salmon. It taste!
I never awful, inedible food appallingly ridiculous price. It's failure execution, plates poorly put together, flavors sides sauces protein marry well all. I severely disappointed plating, got mad I started eating. You would think 44$ steak would least properly cooked. What supposed medium, came raw. The steak tough tasteless. Ahi tuna, asked rare, overcooked; also bland, even sauce. The oshinko side laughable. Seriously. I laughed. pasta overcooked, time got us, sauce laminated coagulating fat. The sushi amatuer attempt best. There much rice, presentation sad. Ambience tacky. Ugly 80s-reminiscent wallpaper covers half room framed sketches fish plaster half. Service redeeming quality. To put perspective, neighborhood Houlihans seems gourmet next place.
We staying Westin late Original Fish Market right site. Well experience hotel restaurant dismal. We waited long seated hosted seemed attitude asked one servers find her. A simple "Sorry wait" would nice. We leave waiting 15 mins waiter. Unfortunately not. The food bland tasteless. Oh! Except bold taste Obay fries. I blackened rainbow trout. I expected bold favors yet nothing. It even blackened. Looked like paprika color, it. Mash potatoes dry tasted gritty like came box. We skipped dessert obvious reasons. I adverse paying top dollar great meal. I hate paying top dollar lousy meal I could done better myself. Do favor avoid Original Fish Market. I generous give one star.
Terrible crab bisque. My husband liked fish stew though. It lots beans, thick chili-like. The rest lunch unnoteworthy, I can't remember I ordered, though almost still plate end lunch. I remember bad taste mouth rest day.
Literally worst restaurant experience I've ever had, including McDonald's 24-hour scarf-and-barf diners. Pittsburgh undergoing bit food renaissance, yet Original Fish Market continues put inferior product horrendous atmosphere obscene price. Our fish tasteless rubbery, white wine came room temperature, restaurant extremely dirty, server clearly apathetic. The Original Fish Market opened 1998, quickly found place market city Red Lobster still considered "good seafood". As top-notch restaurants entered market, local palates grew big way. The Original Fish Market seems content remain frozen time competing mediocre option served market space. Unfortunately them, market space flooded options offering far superior product fraction price.
I went lunch last week. The food awful. Do waste money restaurant.
One places open downtown 10 pm mid-week. Terrible service, average overpriced food, hotel lobby, doesn't make good combo.
Seriously, terrible. Just around terrible. We've OFM twice now... first visit acceptable, second absolutely terrible. We late reservations quick bite lovely night O'Reilly celebrate husband's birthday. As sushi lovers, thought would great way end celebration. We sat sushi bar couldn't get attention waitress sushi chef. After exhausting 20+ min wait seats I go find someone, finally able place order. Again... waiting, waiting. Oh, wait enhanced guests hotel (tweens loaded makeup appeared dance competition drunk parents) standing behind us. No, eating, standing there... yelling, 11pm. Our server returned bring husband's glass warm white wine commented terrible experience must be, nothing help... drink refills, offer call manager, nothing. Hubby sent 14$ glass bath water, I mean, wine, back bar, replaced with, guessed it! another glass warm white wine. Our sushi finally ready edible enjoyable... flavor fish hard rice. We left finishing 40$ meal (1 glass wine, 1 water, 1 roll, 2 orders sashimi). I almost asked manager, frankly tired waiting wanted get there. To top off, paid $12 valet parking would validated unless spent $50 restaurant. We give another chance suggest don't give first.
DIDN'T EAT HERE...this review food. We went Friday night around 8pm, seemed 25% occupancy. The hostess asked us reservation, didn't , told us somewhat behind would wait 20-30 minutes. WTF? We IMMEDIATELY left frankly worth going back again. shame, fish good there. Crappy hostess sure.
I've Fish Market many, many times last 18 years so. It doesn't change much. They get maximum money average seafood (or anything else). The sushi wasn't great last trip (last week), didn't taste terribly fresh. The Miso soup barely average. I like Tataki roll, saving grace meal. Overly expensive get, service range average terrible. Oh, bartender that's long I've going seriously crappy, I'm amazed he's lasted long - union gig?
Stopped lunch. No greeter weren't sure go. Super expensive portions. My salad dressing center. The rest dry. My sweet potato fries came breaded shrimp tasted BBQ-ish weird. But worst breaded shrimp actually curly hair cooked bread ing. It disgusting. The waitress apologized offered replace appetitive gone then. She however offer comp meal. I would absolutely return recommend anyone. Way overpriced hair disgusting unwanted bonus :-(
Went Monday around 7:00. The bar filled usual suspects; guys Brioni suits drinking away stress, unfortunate weather reality head home wives dropped 3-5k pottery barn. The drinks solid, fair priced (based NY Chicago pricing) The open(ish) floor plan would accommodate happy hour well. The food hand - absolutely horrible. We lamb, chili prawns, ahi, chicken (something) Chorizo. The 'fusion' southern Spain meets Japanese influenced small plates works, execution deplorable. Verdict: Drink avoid food costs...
SO disappointed place! I've wanting try time finally boy...what letdown. I heard one downtown's happening Happy Hour places, Tuesday night I went, 99% empty. The menu pretty random everything tried really average. The drinks weren't anything special either. No innovation food, drinks, decor.
Girls looking sugar daddy, guys looking cougar, you're pretentious douche: Bossa Nova place you. The atmosphere downright tragic hard tries. The bar prices scream proletariat: "Let drink beer street! We want bourgeois here." Even DJ Gallery Crawl weeks back tragic. I mean I know DJ appease sugar daddies cougars every place Pittsburgh required 80s music? I'm sure liquor license application. That said, barstaff generally friendly quick - likely don't realize paid eight dollars beer.
Roland's recommended hotel. Service terrible. Food cold. Brick oven pizza cold.... Asked reheated , still came back cold. Steak way cooked. Never got appetizer ordered, charged it. Was busy waitress hard find. Would go back would recommend place anyone.
Friends warned eat here. Turns GOOD friends. This awful, start finish. Slow (pitiful) service, nasty food ( sprung lobster roll -- call that!) generally miserable experience. And early lunch customers around. The thing remotely redeemable sat balcony overlooking Penn avenue entertained people below. People watching blast. I wanted draft beer told "we don't serve draft beer upstairs". What??? There's bar there!! Are kidding me?? So water took long time arrive. And without straws - another wait I audacity ask them. The "lobster rolls" arrived looked mighty meager. That's lobster roll!! But I pressed on. As I got closer mouth slight aroma. But press on. The "lobster" sparse, tough, flavorless. How often could say lobster??? Exactly!! It must harvested years ago waited show could make way freezer. At $15 falls clearly ripoff category. And trying get check? Ridiculous. I won't back. Ever.
This place awesome...bloody mary's fire prosciutto wrapped shrimp?! Get atta tahn! Lobster roll boot get
I use love Rolands. However, last times terrible. While food remains okay, service leaves something desired. Our waitress took longer 15 minutes come get drink order; get hostess find her. She come back table 20 minutes time. The waitress rude less helpful. Our 1 drink lunch took two hours complete. Good thing still good bloody mary.
So, four us came first time. Diner 1 - ordered lobster roll sandwich. Lobster roll, nothing more...that's it. Nothing special - idea people would rave this. A bland, poor excuse sandwich disservice northeasterners know lobster roll is, ain't it. Is lobster? Read on. Diner 2 - ordered large raw bar sampler, six Quahog clams, six oysters six rubbery shrimp. Who serves tough, chewy Quahogs raw bar? This dive. Also ordered mussels, seasoned swimming water. No wine/garlic sauce advertised menu - water. Bland awful. Finished Mediterranean pizza spinach, feta olives - better part dinner. Diner 3 - steamed clams. Again serves Quahogs steamed clams? These amateurs. Also clam chowder - appropriately minced Quahogs it. Diner 4 - ordered salad lobster roll, hold bread. Also asked lobster served chilled it. Lobster came hot dyed deep red color. Why need put lobster dye? Because...it's Maine lobster! Imposter fish dyed artificially flavored, frozen, thawed, microwaved Roland's called lobster. That's guess. Sent mussels back. No offer reduce check offer comped dessert. Rest rooms dirty, smell urine. Men's awful smelling pit I told ladies one toilet drenched urine seat, another blocked overflowing third could used. This place smelly, dingy, dive bar horrible food poor service. It trap unsuspecting tourist. You warned...STAY AWAY!
If 0 stars possible I'd give em. Got back yesterday evening I physically ill. I didn't even touch anemic, yellow fishy smelling muscles - waiter asked hadn't eaten them, character moment. My ahi tuna steak decent, I think scallops got friend sick well. Just saying - check food waiter walks off. Speaking waiter - one worst I've ever displeasure umm served by? That sounds awkward vaguely jack-assy ... Hmm mild poisoning I affecting wit, follow me. This guy spilled half water oysters trying put plate down, didn't notice say anything did; asked I wanted tuna steak prepared??! Worst spoke low monotone customers cars going drown tell asked something he's standing kind 'come on!' look face - totally rude completely inept. I hard put give 10% tip honest. I'd suggest similar bar road better quality food service. Good luck there!
I've tried tried give place chance. It's upsets establishment like exist among many great places Strip. I end Roland's boyfriend's co-workers always want go happy hour. They special oysters shrimp cocktail, I ordered those. The oysters absolutely disgusting. They fresh, cleaned well. My fingers ended getting dirty gross, gritty taste them. They threw POORLY deveined shrimp ice, ended soggy. I pick veins myself, two I lost appetite. As always, service terrible. Next time I'm dragged happy hour there, I'll order water. Never I spend money place. YUCK!
Service great, however, food mediocre. Hostess needs educated menu, unable give details menu items. Lets start fries seem mandatory entree. They cooked prior us ordering, even getting there. They cold, limp (pause) salted. The burger eh. Grilled onions seemed warmed grill, beef patty could used bit flavor. Fat flavor people! Oh, floor first table filthy. Then table second table filthy. What's that? Overall, joint great.
I really wanted like place. The beer choices casual menu right alley. Unfortunately food not. The "famous" lobster roll much butter I think I going heart attack sleep tonight. Can't recommend place.
Rough experience today - one drink left. Waited 15-20 minutes service busy. When I said something - everyone wanted blame someone else - waitress couldn't describe beer didnt iffer find sample - brought 12 year old son pop little kids cup. Waitress apologize cup late - chose leave.
WARNING ,,,,, place SUCKERS ONLY ..... funky smelling ,worse tasting seafood ... overpriced ..... raunchy,un-clean restrooms .... reason anyone goes ''tourist trap '' type neighborhood fun shopping spots nearby restaurant positioned center everything. As P.T. Barnum said '' There's sucker born every minute '' ...... stay away ... restaurant better .
Stopped Fourth July evening cocktail small meal. From horrible service terrible seafood...would never return. We waited long time cocktails order taken, little crowd around restaurant. Then, oyster order came plate water, ice. They small shriveled warm. Next, mussels white wine sauce....hahahah. Um, no...it like garbage sewer sauce. Mussels freezing COLD. Had search server get check, took long time again. Normally, I would complain right terrible food service one days going nicely complaining food would ruin mine husband's infrequent night without kids. I feel strongly enough write review. How seafood place serve terrible seafood? I never given 0 star review worked food service industry. This place terrible. Spend money somewhere else.
I think solid 3 stars good way explain reason really great things really horrible things. First, starving pulled here. Like fricken hungry ordered ton food lol. So got calamari worst calamari, maybe even worst seafood, I ever had. Now, seafood place would think wouldn't happen. It sooooo cooked tasted like rubber band. Then I got side salad husband got bowl clam chowder. Salad great, fresh peppercorn dressing extremely tasty. My husbands chowder....the best soup I ever had! It creamy ton clams it. I mean it, best clam chowder far I ever had! So point confused. So I got Italian style pizza spicy sausage which, I say wasn't bad. The sausage kick crispy crust. The sauce lacked little, prob tomatoes. My husband got famous hot lobster roll and, like everything else, enormous pretty good. Roll buttery lobster cooked well. The service wasn't bad, extremely slow. So I really confused place thing I knew give 3 stars bc I idea I would come back not? Maybe calamari mistake? I don't know. I would come back soup sure...but seafood place mess fried calamari appetizer...come on!
The wait staff looked like bussed homeless shelter. The strange hostesses seated party 4, & took 25 minutes get first beers. Ordered app & left 25 minutes later, lobster nachos never came, sucked I quote excited those. The place gross! There food & trash floor & I watched several women exit restroom disgusted looks face restroom nasty. This confirmed wife. Skip place & go anywhere else Strip District
I liked bar. The food all. First time here, wife I sat bar people watched WELL POURED drinks. Strong point. Then screwed ordered food. I got infamous lobster roll. Glad I drink. Overcooked dry, dry, dry. I thought lobster roll generally made lobster salad-like mix. This lobster dry chewy. Lots it, though I guess accounts high price. I went Wholeys got much tastier one 5 bucks. And wife's nachos big pile chips toppings thrown top. Then day, went back I tried pizza. Yuck. The toppings terrible (pepperoni, sausage. youscrew up, did.) Two slices boxed hurt waitress' feelings. But went trashcan street. Go hootch food!!
Stopped last night wanted 'step out' usual places Carson St. The place rather busy pleasantly warm cold Saturday night. We found seats bar friendly bartender greeted us took drink order. The drafts arrived right away requested menu's... We ordered 2 shrimp cocktails calamari. The shrimp arrived within 5 minutes came small bowl cocktail sauce dollop horseradish top. I mixed mine I love horseradish friend would preferred side another bowl isn't fan. The shrimp big fresh delicious. I mean- really mess cold shrimp...? The calamari took half hour arrive. It pleasing eye smelled delicious. It grilled onions & peppers slight spice dusted top. I thought delicious wife wasn't digging it. She thought overcooked & rubbery. Our friend isn't fan calamari didn't 3rd opinion deciding factor... Then things went south... My wife went ladies room came straight disgusted look face. I saw stop waitress 'chat' waitress turned away rolled eyes. Well, wife said bathroom disgusting- Toilet paper & paper towels floor, 5 stalls half roll toilet paper shared 5, paper towels dry hands washed them. Does employees separate washroom use use one also don't notice??? The health dept signs say "Employees must wash & dry hands soap & hot water". Then I visited Men's room found almost thing- paper floor stalls, I didn't notice tp there, paper towels dry hands with. To us- bathrooms must clean & well stocked wonder kitchen & 'back house' areas look like. If bathrooms much need attention- kitchen must worse... We paid tab left...
I think one star HIGHLY generous restaurant. My family I visited Roland's Sunday afternoon lunch. It far worst experience restaurant I had. My husband I ordered Lobster Rolls I order daughter pasta kids menu. It took staff SO LONG bring lunch finally came, husband I got sandwiches, daughter got nothing. Of course happy all, trying calm down, giving food something, really wanted pasta. My husband went talk manager, server came STILL NO PASTA. 15-20 minutes later pasta finally came out. And course scalding hot. Not pasta hot inedible (especially kid) POOL greasy butter oil bottom bowl. I think kid ate grease actual pasta. It DISGUSTING. This absolutely horribly disappointment restaurant. Not mention lobster roll even great definitely worth $16. (Maybe would better didn't sit plate twenty minutes I waited daughter's food). Don't waste time here, especially kids. The staff (minus waitress really nice wasn't fault) bunch bozos.
Ugh I could give place -10 stars I would. What nightmare. To start, first time I ate here, I almost swallowed giant shard plastic salad. Then horror, bar tending goes "whoops." tosses floor!! Fast forward couple months, I decide give place second chance. (I must delirious hunger.) First bar tender rude, slow hell terrible making drinks. My friend order food 20 min later comes friends food. After almost hour waiting, I still NO pizza. When I asked cranky pants bar tender NICEST possible way, was, shrugged walked away. I asked speak manager told "busy." Finally someone came talk hour half I got shitty pizza. Thank kitchen manager job coming talk customer. But, bar tender working earlier New Year's Eve. You DO NOT DESERVE THIS JOB AND SHOULD BE FIRED.
Absolutely waste time money. Service terrible. Wait staff focused sweeping table still seated, pre bussing table. The food terrible way overpriced. I never even opportunity complain food server never asked. I'm leaving table still covered dishes empty beer glasses. Just awful.
I've last night probably last time I ever type desire eat food. My boyfriend I meeting parents dinner everywhere tried booked reservation Pitts graduation weekend. We ended Roland's seated within 5 minutes. Our waitress combination ditzy, snobby bored. She awkward uncomfortable every time came table. She good candidate service industry, opinion. We ordered lobster roll sliders start. There 4 us brought three. No big deal- mom I split one....but waitress brought three plates. I ordered Maryland crab soup (specified first) hot lobster Caesar salad. My salad came shortly appetizer sliders. I sat 15 minutes without touching salad wait rest everyone get food. Finally delivered. My dad boyfriend seafood stew said good mom pasta di mare (she said ok. Lacking flavor) salad (which never given didn't realize left). No soup apparently. I requested waitress please bring out. She unapologetic. When I finally got dive hot lobster (now cold lobster) caesar, I realized lettuce, little cheese lobster. At point I irritated everything I didn't even care - I surprised quality dish given everything leading it. The lobster good good bit plus Caesar dressing I always like. The Maryland crab soup tasted like chunky tomato marinara sauce I gave boyfriend go home use homemade seafood pasta dish. My mom disgusted clams dish suggested probably frozen. Do favor go street luke wholeys Alaskan grill get much better quality seafood price. After I there; I feel totally ripped Roland's. No bueno.
Tried workday afternoon, wasn't disappointed. Came another day, holy crap, people move speed snails LSD. Unless beer, forget it.
My meet group wanted eat dinner I really sure I wanted go changed mind. Our group seated main dining area across giant screen TV. Our leader asked could seated elsewhere could chat one another. It 5 hostess said could go another room 6:30. Everyone agreed. The waitress came took drink orders first. When went serve us spilled beverage right table narrowly missing hit someone sitting diagonal I thought normal mishap area cleaned properly. I hesitant I wanted order decided upon vegetable salad. Our leader normally treats us appetizer case chicken nachos. I tried one could taste chicken otherwise tasted okay. Later waitress began serving main courses I noticed spilling sauces floor placed front guest. I grateful I ordered salad. It nothing ordinary could get salad anywhere. The person next ordered beer battered giant fish sandwich. He offered piece try I bit I could taste beer batter. No fish. Enough said. I done meal noticed 6:20 I told group time get go could table. This certainly place I go own. There much better establishments area.
Terrible experience here. The food way overpriced tasted like overcooked slabs meat. We ordered mussels appetizer, swordfish entree, ahi tuna entree. We got appetizer, salads, entrees time everything cold. I don't know manage overcook food it's still cold, that's happened. The mussels barely seasoned hardly edible. I never complain restaurants, meals bad complain manager. Luckily, appologized took one entrees off. I can't believe bad food they're charging much it. It awful.
Let's call place is: it's racist establishment. 3~4 bartenders going around bar exiting carnival ride. Taking care everyone else asked I wanted Hailed one drink. Didn't even offer food menu. After three sips I asked food menu. Bartender nearly tosses across table. Paid lousy $6 beer got up. The whole time patron next eyeing whole situation expecting bigger reaction me. Asked manager brought attention. His response: "oh, I idea, I apologize"
I used frequent visitor Roland's...the food always good beer always cold.....well particular Friday afternoon. I went friend lunch rush....we sat bar, little short time. There 1 bartender working service little slow. We ordered 2 beers 2 fish sandwiches.......the beer luke-warm....it came tap much foam I could tell sat front me.....then tried argue fact beer warm.....NOT A GOOD START! He finally conceded replace beer little colder (but much) gave lame explanation temp right, took order waited, waited, waited 45mins sandwiches come out...... I want say fish hot, also greasy fried refried let sit dirty brown grease...not mention fries cold. So waiting another 15-20mins bartender asked food....of course complained know waited 15 mins talk manager TIM.....he snarky sarcastic....when told fish greasy returned "well fried grease".....DUH! TIM! kinda knew that!......needless say finish beer food....we went street Wholey's got hot fish sandwich minus grease.
I'm really wanting hate place I like atmosphere isn't good. Bad service, horrible Bloody Mary's (maybe worst), beers warm, got appetizers (Chicken nachos) deciding leave. The four us afraid order anything else. This place recommended us sister law. I've always though little nuts proved it.
I regretted coming almost immediately. It took 10 minutes get waters. All entrees came different times. My friend ordered seafood stew oysters extremely chewy nearly inedible. I spit oyster napkin. This first last time I'm coming here.
On slow night takes: 20 minutes water 30 minutes beer 60+ minutes soup raw entrees Come hungry, leave hungrier bitter wasted time money.
Came got lobster nachos appetizer we're waiting pizza, drinking got it... Oh yeah never did. After hour half... Lobster nachos unreal - service absolutely horrible tell waiter something say "sure thing" there's guarantee sill get.
Not sure food 2 us party sick eating last night. The thing ate different rest party clam chowder.
Waited seated 15 minutes, one greeted us. Asked passing waitress seat ourselves. Waitress walked stairs shouted NO! 10 minutes later, waitress passed asked could seated. She walked stairs ignored us. We asked totalk manager threw arms said, find him! Needless say, returning place.
BEWARE Duquesne/Pitt families visiting anyone else! Awful food service! Super slow, cold fries, freezer burned carrots, rubbery lobster claws. Wait, Ceasar salad ok! Who hunts server 10 minutes get check! We could've left without paying, I believe Karma. NO Stars!
I ate dinner group celebrate friend's birthday. My overall opinion service terrible food overpriced. Our drinks took 15-20 minutes arrive. We drinking beers, I'm sure took long. We wait extremely long time food, I would estimate least 45 minutes. We ordered calamari bruschetta appetizers, served entrees. When started eat became obvious food sitting while. Anyone french fries said cold. I ordered rosemary shrimp scampi, came mashed potatoes broccoli/carrot mix. The mashed potatoes lukewarm best, vegetables cold. I ate broccoli, I don't like raw carrots I didn't eat those. It honestly looked like threw handful baby carrots onto plate. As shrimp itself, tasted good wasn't I expected. I expecting pasta-type dish, 5 6 pieces shrimp garlic butter bath. And I don't think pieces shrimp cold vegetables cost $23, especially I still hungry meal. To top off, realized halfway meals never given napkins. We ask twice brought out. The good thing experience beer selection. If I ever come back I stick bar waste time money food.
I ended eating hunger exhaustion weekend pittsburgh last week. We mentioned server unsure wanted offered help, walked away kept coming back table every minutes saying, "so, get you?". We decided things order. Worst service i've long time, rude didn't really care help us all. We ended getting lobster ravioli wood fired pizza average best. For $30 meal each, great. Really service me. I remember never return i'm pittsburgh. Another thing sitting basically sports bar spending$30 ravioli. Horrible atmosphere food menu parts.
Here vacation waitress seemed annoyed wanted food. Who know wanted food restaurant.
Second time I ordered food times. Clam Chowder lumps flour tasted like flour. Lobster roll dry salty. If anyone asked, I would shared comments. The Bloody okay. I'll drink again, won't eat.
gets 1 star, I can't given 0. ordered chicken salad go nice, sucked. awful. lack chicken brown, mushy lettuce. better getting salad fast food joint. I see place hurting business.
Terribly salty "lobster roll" greasy bread. Undercooked fries. Beer good though! I wouldn't come back food! 16.00$ lobster roll inedible lobster
Literally disgusting. Their food gross I've seen nice running around there.
We arrived around 4:30 Wednesday Jason Isbell show Benedum, seemed like opening. Only couple couples guy bar. No host bartender asked going eat. Sure man, it's restaurant, right? Go figure... We told sit anywhere someone would right us. After 15 minutes one came table I started get go bar menu, server saw getting came over. Asked server beer menu told didn't any. Really? My girlfriend looked around found one lying another table. Strike two. Ordered lobster Mac n cheese appetizer. DEFINITELY enough two people split, even appetizer, ok us thought pretty bland called "Mac n cheese" Sherlock Holmes would tough time finding lobster there. For dinner I ordered pan seared scallops red mashed potatoes. I think $23 something like INSANE I got, 8 single-bite sized, overcooked completely flavorless pieces small mound cold potatoes. Extremely disappointed dish. The half got prosciutto arugula pizza. When came table, completely topped raw arugula inch deep, I skeptical didn't even try got home later night. I wrong one pizza delicious point. After first round I sit beerless 15 minutes one two servers came see I wanted another (I did), fairly attentive, even though gave us vibe somehow annoyed there. Our total bill dinner, appetizer 4 draft beers came $80, way steep considering quality food service. Maybe we'd go back grab drink bar, food much better choices strip district.
Been coming years especially get lobster roll. Had town guests I wanted take somewhere Pittsburgh! Lobster roll good awesome like I remember. It dry I asked extra butter lemon. The waitress however rude I'm hoping bad day. She brought wrong appetizer I brought attention snapped "that's I wrote down" I know I would never ordered it. So I said it's ok bring correct one never did. I always tip well cause I'm restaurant business one times I thought tipping all. ( I gave 15% 20%) good polite service staff makes big difference even food off. But bad service it's inexcusable.
I picky eater; however, perhaps absolute worst food I ever served restaurant. My brother I came Sunday hungry day walking around strip. Worst decision ever made; actually laughed nasty was. I think calamari served actually pieces chopped dyed car tire. Then, brother got prosciutto arugula pizza. like 2 pieces prosciutto it, thought would good idea literally throw pieces ice cold arugula top unmelted parm cheese sort lemon sauce. nasty. My chicken sandwhich also made rubber chicken. truly horrifying experience. Oh, seated us huge room, alone, awkward waitress rude short. THIS FOOD TASES LIKE PLASTIC. OH YEAH AND THE FRENCH FRIES WERE LITERALLY SOGGY PIECES OF MOIST PLASTIC HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. go unless want throw
This one worst experiences I restaurant. I went 9 others. They squeezed 10 people 2 small tables given restaurant fairly empty. It mid March (and hot outside) kept patio doors open. I repeatedly asked close completely since friends cold would not. The way describe food disgusting. -I split giant beer battered fish sandwich. Given apparently place seafood place one would think seafood decent... wrong. The fries cold, sandwich fries greasy. - Our friends got classic white pizza. Between two finished one piece couldn't tolerate anymore. I tried bite it. It tasted like eating clove garlic bit dough. - No one else enjoyed meals either. The waiter terrible. He would take couple peoples drink food order walk away repeated throughout night. He friendly needed something found. Some people left early. We ask clear cups could move space. When clearing table end noticed majority pizza left. He asked friends wanted packed up. They said didn't like don't want take home. He said ok. Thats it- didn't ask why, didn't offer take bill, didn't apologize, nothing! Overall food, service, atmosphere deserve 1 star. I would recommend them. In fact, I would go way make sure one I know would suffer gain Rolands.
I took 14 year old daughter dinner 6pm Roland's prior Penguins playoff game yesterday. They gave us table seating near bar waitress excellent. They nice selection beers really enjoyed food. So "2 star" rating? There rowdy group eight partiers adjacent bar clearly drunk screaming (and cursing) entire time. I concerned bartender kept providing booze, even one patrons fell bar stool twice! When finally ready leave, drunkest man group yelled friends he'd go get car. This bad news around shows great deal irresponsible behavior bartenders management team. It made dining experience terrible couple dozen patrons near bar allowed obviously drunk person leave bar drive car. On top that, young daughter exposed ridiculous behavior. Even waitress embarrassed behavior apologized it, bartenders nothing. Shame you, Roland's!
Terrible service!!! Told 45 minute wait food. Sarcastic bartender place half empty. No one wanted wait us!
Don't, don't...the food leaves lot desired. The steamed mussels arrived grey broth looked like sewage water. The crab cakes cold overly salty. It loud there, scream across table talk. The saving grace friendly, professional waitress.
Several weeks ago, friend's birthday drinking day started Roland's. I dinner drinks many, many different restaurants, service worst I've experienced entire life. A good sized group (probably 15 time left) gathered upstairs near bar. So here's happened: -Stood bar waiting 5-10 minutes served bartenders walked by, ignoring us -Received grumbling responses bartenders asked assistance -Asked menus told "food would take least 30-40 minutes" served -Food arrived left bar get cold, later told bartender "didn't see were" - standing literally 6 feet away ordered -A friend's food thrown away - uneaten - immediately delivery "it looked like done" What horrible experience. Thankfully, later stops much better. I never plan return Roland's disappointed well-known Pittsburgh establishment would sub-par service.
We took dad dinner birthday. There 6 us, Sunday evening - busy, seemed understaffed. We able seated immediately, nice. All staff friendly. Those positive things I say experience. We ordered appetizers. When waitress brought admitted forgotten put dads order stuffed mushrooms in. Actually, didn't even remember ordered tell again. My appetizer Cajun shrimp, WAY seasoned. I couldn't even see shrimp underneath thick crust Cajun seasoning. It least 1/4" thick, scraped off. But much I couldn't even taste shrimp point, crusty dry chunks seasoning. My sister ordered oysters. She said shucked/cleaned correctly, grit oysters. My dads stuffed mushrooms finally arrived well salads. They didn't discount take bill anything, I find annoying since waitress admitted completely forgot arrived 30 minutes ordered. As meals, series mediocrity mistakes. My steak, ordered medium, served well, fathers. I chose send mine back, meant I got steak everyone already finished meals. My lobster tail chewy "stuffing" good. My father said scampi "okay". My sister ordered Pasta Di Mare - said basically pasta covered olive oil, largely bland unseasoned, instead wine sauce. My sister crab cakes, said bland dry. My brother law lobster roll, seemed winner night. He said decent. Not great, decent. My sisters fiancé ordered seafood stew described sauce "milk, old bay seasoning it." He said "gross". The mashed potatoes great, everyone agreed that. I see sister pull hair salad dressing. I also big ol fly land, twitching, right plate I moving steak. I could sworn popped wilted piece lettuce steak served on...but sister said didn't think so. She killed napkin since seemed throes death already. The bathrooms disgusting. This probably worst review restaurant I've ever written. I feel bad waitress really nice... But place awful. I probably give one star, I felt like waitress really trying hardest give us good experience. I feel worse need take dad another dinner make - complainer I could tell disappointed. We go back recommend Roland's.
Terrible tuxedo rentals! I went 2 months good friend's wedding get sized order tuxedo. The salesman measured know doing, continued ask someone else 'doing right' made extremely uncomfortable. At moment I wanted give benefit doubt would get right. When I picked up, fit!! They go third party easy way remedy situation. They ship replacement I going since town wedding. I return another Jos. A Bank store I want go back RPM location see guy fit originally. When I returned I wanted see could extreme amount inconvenience hassled I wanted refund! I going use bridal party tuxedos next year, way now. All employees said go third party wonder rentals easier! Ha! POOR EXCUSE FOR A GENTLEMAN'S STORE. Oh, expensive! However, Jack RPM store kind helped make bad situation better.
The staff downtown location tend rude. I walk wearing higher end suits treating I bothering them. I considering using tux rental, unwilling allow would wearing tux simply get measured tux COLOR chosen me. I told "its difficult change colors system". I decided call online store told store associate wrong could definitely get set-up tux I could call back colors. It late decided go Tuxedo Junction. I shopped Jos A Banks locations 8 years now. The service greatly decreased point I don't interest visiting store; especially downtown location. They rarely provide quality customer service. On another occasion I went get measured send measurement cousins suit retailer wedding. Being customer company I didn't think big ask. I hurried coat that's would size. They would get tap measure seemed annoyed I asked try different size jacket different style.
Interesting little shop Market Square. If you're going sit outside eat dessert might well coffee. A chocolate cinnamon swirl latte exact. It little crazy, tight unexpected inside, narrow aisle separating numerous selections whole bean coffee tea left coffee bar right. They also sell chocolate covered beans even small selection cigars. With many choices, I might need come back I time browse.
Wide variety coffee & teas - even cigars. Relaxed atmosphere & friendly people. Lots flavored coffees, though I'm huge fan flavored coffees.
I'd heard good reviews, I stopped last time I downtown, I'm impressed coffee. Dark roasted, bitter, etc. If I'm looking coffee downtown, I'd go find 21st St. Coffee branch instead. Still, sell bunch neat snacks stuff, beats chain.
This place come run banana hazelnut flavored coffee.
Myself company customer years. The aroma place little confections quite welcoming indeed. One thing they've failing terribly customer service barista bar quality. It's sometimes tough get waited even nobody store. The girls working counter treat nuisance interrupting time phones. It's gotten bad, This past weekend I went order espresso. The girl working barista cold, rude served worst excuse espresso I ever life. She clearly clue, pride care coffee making. I take time write review hoping improve. It's embarrassing tourists staying Fairmont, anywhere else, walk Market Square expect great coffee espresso quaint little shop instead receive rude treatment terrible espresso. I hope address issue. We buy least 10lb beans month there, probably more.
I go almost weekly. You get huge grilled chicken salad bread tzatiki $6.25. Absolutely worth money.
I several times last year. The food average...kind fast-food-like. It sits warmer cases, looks "crusty". The gyros average, good ones South Side gyro restaurant, means. The salads bag pre-chopped lettuce, "fresh" interesting. But order enjoy average food, get past really rude food wait staff. The bartenders seem OK, clientele bar seem regulars, "cheap drink" attraction downtown locals. The staff serves food, takes orders world rude. There one wins prize insulting customers, endured her, I never, ever return. Owners know represented front register. The man cooks plates food oblivious, used hearing speak people lack respect, deaf it. Go somewhere else. It cheap food, get pay for. I would pay twice much, feel like staff gave crap I supporting jobs.
I stopped last night dinner CM we'd spent afternoon Duquesne University, since I City Dining Card Salonika, it'd awhile since CM I Greek food. The first thing note surprised bit Salonika doesn't provide table service--orders payment accepted front, food provided trays take table dining area. The staff bus tables, clearly needed time visit. Based Yelpers' recommendations, I ordered rosemary half chicken lemon potatoes ($7.39), CM same. While flavor entree decent, I found extremely greasy, I suspect chicken wasn't best quality, since pieces bone kept breaking ending mouth. As lemon potatoes, again, flavor point, texture off, mushy places hard prevent chewing others. The sauce plate potatoes great flavor, I used dip chicken complimentary pita bread came entrees into, also quite greasy chicken. CM I also decided order dessert, ordering baklava ordering chocolate cake, looked super-tempting case. I'm happy report cake didn't disappoint--it substantial moist thick, fudgy icing pleasant, though unexpected, tinge anise flavor. I tried piece CM's baklava, enjoyed well--it generous coating honey, plenty chopped nuts. Overall, I found food Salonika inexpensive (at least, entrees Cultural District) flavorful, lacking somewhat execution. I'd consider returning next time I'm downtown craving Greek food, since I believe Salonika one gyro places downtown stays open beyond lunch hours. If I'm looking nicer sit-down dinner, however, I'll pass Salonika one many restaurants vicinity. 3.5 stars.
It cold inside restaurant. I posieden salmon filo dough tough I couldn't cut plastic fork. My husbands pork small portion. It inexpensive I understand why. Won't go back recommend it.
I'm generous since I didn't actually eat here. My dad I walked around 7 pm Friday night. The place pretty busy. The dining room half full. The half tables covered dirty dishes. A large party people gathered middle standing around shouting loudly. People seemed standing around whole place reason. We told lady counter hadn't asked do. She said order food. She said pretty rudely, still weren't exactly sure do. We decided didn't want eat place lousy service, filthy tables, unruly patrons walked out.
Sucks. I walked across thd bridge, rain, got closing doors already locked. Why post closing time isn't honored?
This odd little CVS. However, it's close workplace, convenient place shop I want mid-day snack beverage.
Just got small, pre-made chicken salad sandwich cup chicken chili Fifth Avenue store, paid $9. You get much better quality value elsewhere Pittsburgh.
In one day,this place went fav everyday go-to,to somewhere I'd rather go again. I getting thing every day, toasted bagel butter creme cheese. For reason,I given raw,stale bagel margarine (which I hate). I feel like like 3 weeks daily visits, always getting thing,a toasted bagel butter shouldn't difficult. I really hungry too! This happened before,but I let go. Nobody things perfectly every day. After yesterday though,I'm gonna go Crazy Mocha next door awhile.
I've eaten La Gondola's I attest baked sandwiches da bomb. I wasn't hungry lunch today felt I needed get something I decided slice pizza. The atmosphere would expect Pittsburgh Italian family owned pizzeria. Clean yet little cramped; friendly overly so; service exactly slow simple slice pizza wasn't "freakishly fast" either. The two waitresses two behind counter cooking seem good time. My slice pizza came looked yummy. The crust perfectly done cheese artfully oozing pepperoni. Esthetically beautiful. Unfortunately I bit it, taste average. It wasn't bad, crust held fine sauce lacking "oomph"... zest look eating pizza (at least it's I look for). Don't get wrong, wasn't bad slice pizza, average. Average taste, average size, even average temperature. I wouldn't go way slice pizza here. But I wouldn't put fuss I group wanted go. But I'd probably opt one tasty sandwiches maybe try one pasta dishes pizza.
The menu small underwhelming. The flatbread pizza likely came box. They didn't sauces, gave us ketchup go cooked shrimp/bacon extremely greasy fries.
First impression: The guys borderline rude I dropped car off. I thought I talked someone phone made arrangements. It turns two Monro Muffler locations Penn Ave employee either shop thought bring (then, point), I called wrong location (I found days later). Service: They took car anyway said "they'd get tomorrow", well tomorrow became next day day after... Got call mufflers I bought car turned wrong ones I called around, tracked right ones, dropped correct ones within two hours call. Quality work: All took week get work done I impression would welding whole system together. It turns use clamps bolt stuff together. I asked make tail pipes bends rear axle couldn't 2.5" pipe, turns incapable bending anything 2" pipes there. Instead agreed would easiest cheapest install short turndown pipes. So really wasn't terribly difficult job done. Overall impression: I gave two stars instead one didn't actually break anything lose car burn anything. Pricing came agreed addition turndown pipes. I could saved lot money time done myself.
Terrible slow service.Waited one hour oil change Won't come place....
I get it. It gets busy you're bartender/waitress sometimes. I've myself. But explain things late takes nearly half hour pour glass wine without incredibly rude cold, even say apologetic smile, customers understand. Food fine, won't go back fear server.
I've actually OK experiences place past trip especially bad. I tried stop husband appetizer drink heading theater district - bad move. Upon seated server explained longer serving food water leak something unsanitary-sounding. Klassy. For reasons I truly can't explain, decided stay beer heading destination. We threw brew nasty, paid left. Unfortunately Olive Twist, visit would probably last. On positive note, interesting man setting looked like live acoustic set. His warm-up sounded good left really got started. When it's said done, went Sharp Edge street. Probably much safer bet future endeavors.
Owner manager rude presented yelp deal.
We decided stop Olive Twist recent Saturday night show. A friend wedding upstairs asked us drop say hi. Apparently host wedding receptions lounge area bar/restaurant. I hoping get quick meal drink show. When arrived bar packed told availability sit restaurant section. But, little deter me. I scoped tables bar noticed couple getting ready pay. After making casual chit chat, agreed save table us. They paid left ordered drink bar. As soon got waitress put reserved sign table, I assumed us sat down. Nope. She trying reserve 8pm reservation. I thought bar area seat yourself? Oh well, I told 8 show anyway would work fine. A minutes later came back told us no, won't work find place bar. Seriously? We already sitting seat tables, fine 2 minutes ago, leave 8, what's issue? Rather annoyed looked seats ways inch already overly crowded bar waitress returned said reserve another table leaving. Now, wasted 10 minutes already limited time show so, I asked fastest thing menu. We ordered soup, salad buffalo chicken spread. The soup arrived first. I homemade chicken noodle. Warm, comfort food hit spot. Next pear salad candied walnuts, blue cheese strawberry vinagerette. Again, super tasty. I could snack candied walnuts day. Then buffalo chicken spread. Presentation great-in martini glass. The pita chips delic! But chicken? I searched entire martini glass, one shred chunk chicken. Being buffalo chicken dip lover, I sorely disappointed. As drinks, stick martinis wine also big disappointment.
The drinks perrrrrrrrfect! Totally hit spot. Favorites cookie dough cake batter. Though drinks 5 star, food leaves much desired. Prices high taste subpar. I crab cake - small, dry, expensive scallops - large, dry, expensive interesting strawberry garnish I thought odd addition flavoring produced. Anywho, get drink menu - well worth price yuuuuuumy taste!
Very disappointed. I Olive Twist drinks really enjoyed never meal. I going show Benedum friend made reservations week half show. We arrived 15 minutes early 6:00 reservation expecting may able seated yet. The problem even though I called made reservation (including person answering phone taking name phone number repeating date time) told reservation name. The hostess said something along lines "are sure called make reservation somewhere else" Yes, I'm pretty sure I called right restaurant... She kept looking room empty tables, looking book looking us. After minutes back forth, told us lounge upstairs open welcome grab table there. So trudged upstairs. All available small high top tables. Being Friday night, packed happy hour crowd pretty noisy. Not really environment looking decided make it. We started Buffalo Chicken Dip appetizer. It served martini glass toasted/fried pita chips. It tasty surprised much dip actually was. The problems food began pacing meal. We appetizer five minutes entrees came out. It may big deal real table restaurant downstairs, high top bar tables, room drinks, appetizer meal. We found stacking stuff pulling things table order fit everything. It frustrating. Not mention would either let entrees get cold finished appetizer let appetizer get cold ate entrees. With much enjoyed appetizer, looking forward meals. Unfortunately, disappointing. My friend ordered french dip sandwich side mashed potatoes. Her potatoes ice cold sandwich luke warm. When mentioned server, server said "so would like take back ok" When would cold mashed potatoes ever OK? When potatoes brought back warmed, disappointed called "garlic mashed" said pretty bland much garlic all. I ordered Caribbean Jerk Chicken. It described "grilled chicken seasoned jerk spices, pepper jack cheese, garlic mayo pineapple chutney Kaiser roll" No mention tomato. When I got sandwich, three tomatoes it. Thankfully I dislike tomatoes wasn't allergy issue. There also pineapple chutney. When I asked it, server told use sauce must soaked roll. Overall, disappointed. I wanted love Olive Twist I really enjoyed time I visited drink, dining experience sorely lacking, especially dinner supposed nice laid back start girl's night out.
At request friend, brief girls night Olive Twist. My first impression outdated decor. The restaurant carpet I find putting. The drink menu extensive; but, exception one person party, found drinks far sweet. I ordered cucumber basil martini, sweet I send back. The food mediocre. I ordered burger medium cooked nearly well done. And cheesy lounge singer sang mishmosh singer songwriter tunes 80s. The music loud bad friends I left headed street Butcher Rye.
I stopped last night drink group friends... town visiting I wanting try place since walked past last trip... disappointment. The server prompt greet us drop drink menus, failed return take order least 20 minutes. It would've different slammed, entire time standing bar, talking coworkers. By time came take order ready leave... have... martinis good server's disposition left much desired. When ready leave made us feel like bother split tabs five us. The one positive place I liked ambiance, wasn't enough make everything else lackluster. What I hoping great ending night turned dismal experience put everyone bad mood.
The bar staff great, food quality definitely taken downward turn past year. I recently bar overcome foul smell. For know Urnex is, that's exactly I thought (and hoped) was. Alas, I told bar staff scallops. Worse yet, said come can. I nearly puked. I love place much, I terribly saddened lack quality dishes coming kitchen days.
Not fan service. Or I say lack of. It literally killed leave tip. No one deserves it. And I tipped server never even waited left day. I overtip EVERYBODY today I could leave 20%.
If want SNOTTY attitude place you, sub-par food high prices, found perfect place bad combination. Upon entering door 3:40 pm hostess said us (my daughter I)" We seat promise leave 6pm", take 16-18 tables one table occupied. I guess promised, seat us worse table House, near bathroom/kitchen next fire extinguisher. When told waitress table working, threw menus table next us. The food minimal size minimal care preparation, daughter order salad chicken, salad came first, plate chicken came later customer put top salad. My salmon bland, asked lemon help dish out, never received lemon.. left half salmon uneaten. DO NOT PATRONIZE THIS ESTABLISHMENT
I mixed feelings coming Monday night dinner hearing really bad experience friend mine long ago. We groupon girlfriend purchased use expiring week. The place bit crowded nothing outrageous would make us want go somewhere else, actually seated within five minutes reservation far good right? Well that's ended. Our waitress textbook version horrible service. Drinks took forever delivered table, girlfriends food cold, forgot soup ordered. The food decent ( I pepper crusted salmon) drink "meh". I really don't feel sorry waitress all, attitude horrible, wasn't really busting butt waiting multiple tables. Let known, plan taking orders without writing down, better able deliver. The "acting manager" sat table apologized took extra 15% bill. I couldn't wait get don't plans returning anytime soon.
My husband I waited 10pm come busy private event! I eyes set short ribs basically roast!!!!!! Yes roast! Enough said impressed happy came Syracuse obviously never return! $70 bill wasn't good all!!!!!
When we're mood martini (which, alarmingly, almost always), "go to" place. I'm fan old brick, dimly lit, speakeasy type decor, place it. The food drinks great every time we've stopped by. It tough finding seat busy times ie: games shows, place small, (I still haven't figured top floor for), generally, can't go wrong here.
Called November secure upstairs wedding party instructed accept reservations month prior event. We told call back month prior learn upstairs booked another party. Upon speaking Brandon learned fact accept reservations month out. So either person spoke phone misinformed said get us phone. In case learning Brandon simply stated wrong repeatedly offered alternative. I wasn't expecting cancel party accommodate party. However I asked accommodate us unapologetic rude. The customer service displayed worst I ever seen. Luckily establishment area heard issue SYMPATHETIC worked us resolve issue. I never set foot place spend single cent ever.
So.... This place ok. By I mean drinks food (especially calamari) great. The service much. No acknowledgement arrive. Sit bar. None. They busy. I hate pull race card part town lacks diversity. Asked leave card bar. Couple next us didn't this. I guess thought would run. Never came see doing. I go bar. Worst service I've received while. I wouldn't go flavor descent. :)
Tried order one 5 dinner specials...the lobster mac cheese (at 7 pm... prime time dinner hr).... I ordered peppered salmon mango salsa.... brought meal mango salsa.... salmon...all itself. I asked waitress... didn't come mango salsa topping? She said oh yea does... ran that's didn't put on..... needless say.. would tough eat peppered salmon salsa sauce offset pepper. I wasn't sure point...so said want sauce something? We asked check chef he/she suggests. 5 min later comes says r going make new batch mango salsa....I think myself... I thought making it? Why didn't first place. They left plate front 10 mins later come small bowl salsa... time rest table done food...the meal good salsa... I eating everyone else done food luke warm. For $20 meal high end restaurant. ..This quite disappointment.
Completely agree Deborah: decent sandwich absolutely horrible bread - mealy tomato brown lettuce, too. I know $4/$7 6"/12" sub, pretty bad. (I bought 12", intending take half home later, I wound throwing second half away, I NEVER throw away food.) As Italian grocery, seems okay, attitudes little snippy, it's pretty grungy-looking place.
Maybe it's nostalgia cigar I thought looked ridiculous. He bragged $4 pepperoni roll. There's reason cost that, wasn't good. The sauce disappointing. I wouldn't come anything.
Us New Yorkers try stick four main food groups; garlic bread, pizza bread, fresh bread, cheesy breads! There breads yummy! finish TWO twelve inch pizza bread less day! says lot since don't usually eat much bread... Yes bread fresh! made fresh everyday! Breads short shelf life max 3-4 days stored room temperatures...an hour two shop closed tend sell breads half price buy one get one free...Sunseri Jimmy & Nino go natural ingredients bakeries add artificial flavors, colors ingredients...not place! delish!
The Port Authority bus system Pittsburgh gets lot attention. There lots articles newspapers, regular protests, petitions, etc route reduction fare hikes on. Some people think slow, unreliable overcrowded. There's general sense unfair Pitt students ride free much Pitt staff not. And, course, rest city pay too. But I think testament health system. People - students college universities, long-term residents, downtown commuters, school kids - actually value use bus system. In university towns (not name names) schools give entirely shuttle students around private buses, means, end, less ridership, fewer routes less frequently less money public transportation. I also found drivers considerate - especially elderly disabled - helpful could be, given demands time attention. Depending living situation, buses make possible live Pittsburgh one car, none. And I found it's safer take bus snow, too, (if quicker, *sometimes* also is).
First time Pittsburgh, Chicago. 1. NO ONE SEEMS TO KNOW HOW THE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM WORKS. 2. What silly system paying way sometimes? It seems like dumbest idea ever. 3. Where reloadable transit cards? 4. Why conductors incredibly angry? 5. Why I need request stop "T"? Of public transportation systems I've used, definitely confusing far. Even website easier understand fare explanation. Learn CTA. I new appreciation Chicago Transit Authority.
Fares keep going up. Another service cut month. I think I'd rather walk work middle night!
Oh, PAT buses, can't I quit you? Here's deal: I 100% blame Pittsburgh's bus system problems Port Authority. Between winding bus routes, inability buses show time, outrageous money spent retirement plans, disbanded. The city needs take reconfigure entire system. The Post-Gazette printed great pieces explain system could overhauled. I've bus rider since birth (I still never drive), it's gotten worse years. Some routes great (outside rush hours), others ridiculous, good routes recently cut. Until transfers free (which within hour window, opinion), insane cut 500, added $10 week bus tab get work. It usable? If don't care time. I shouldn't show 10 minutes early catch bus coming every 20 minutes according schedule. I shouldn't stand middle downtown traffic flag 28x Airport Flyer I'm standing stop enormous purple suitcase. When I'm going work, I look I arriving...And go back 1-2 time blocks make sure I'm time since I can't trust bus. Bus riders understand buses use exclusive bus lanes, maybe Port Authority build delays happen every day schedule. For example, chance inbound 71B takes similar amount time morning rush hour mid-day. I know experience. Why doesn't schedule know this? The buses bad I two miles work, I walk every day. In fact, I often BEAT 71B home. That means I stroll two miles Fifth Avenue, single bus passes me. On busiest section busiest non-highway street Pittsburgh (data according me). How possible? Finally, live Pittsburgh. It's cold raining miserable year. I would gladly take fewer stops exchange heated bus shelters. It would also nice imaginary shelters could bus arrival information. Pitt's right track bus shelters Cathedral--take note.
Last night marked second time week I waited 30 minutes 71B freezing cold rain. I 5 minutes early bus I trying catch. I understand delay rush hour, not. The bus running every 20 minutes times, according PAT schedule. When I gave last night went apartment, additional 10 minutes bus went by...So let's review: I waited total 45 minutes bus supposed coming past every 20 minutes. For shame! From on, I'll hoofing across East End instead buying bus pass. It cold, least I'll moving.
I don't even really know begin review. I guess sensical thing nonsensical transit system pros cons list. (If nothing quickest least painful you, dear sweet reader.) Pros - It rare find I can't get bus place I want go. Truth told I don't leave city whole lot, anytime I want get somewhere leg work I find bus take I want. My morning bus (especially insanely early 5am 86 Bloomfield work gym downtown) almost always time. Cons - It's known fact last 54 Southside East End/Oakland/Etc rarely never comes "last one" NOT late enough considered bars options get home. It's pretty common buses either full 15 min early 10 min late. I've seen one person pee themselves. I've bus driver plain ignore request stop ignore ME I'm telling much. PACKED buses constantly cutting routes trips. Dirty buses. I've seen dirty diaper two. I don't car it's really mode transportation since catch cabs like normal city. I'd lost without it, could much much much better.
This review based primarily experiences taking 28X Airport Flyer to/from Pittsburgh Airport Oakland. Pros: Convienient cheapest option ride Airport. Cons: takes long time (1.5hrs) reliability sometimes questionable. I've one bus break down, one bus leave 10 mins early, next bus late. Also, main complaint designated area luggage 28X bus. I understand buses weren't made go airport, maybe consider designated Airport service bus. There's nowhere put suitcase, ends walkway taking seat.
Well, get one point A point B Pittsburgh. But it's expensive, least compared Metro Transit Minneapolis I'm used to. On Port Authority, it's $2.25 ticket, extra $1 transfer (which gets one bus, way destination requires bunch transfers.) Coming maximum $3 two half hours bus rides (express bus rush hour), Port Authority steep. I grab cash couple different times make sure I could keep paying fares throughout days. There's day pass. Boo. If you're traveling lot throughout day, adds fast without sort pass. Also, 28X doesn't pick passengers coming downtown Oakland (or drop reverse direction.) Very frustrating, especially Megabus terminal three blocks away one stops. (There's also Greyhound Amtrak downtown, I remember correctly.)
visited pittsburg 3 days rode metro problem im 74 yrs old sign say seniors medicaid card state id ride free would accept new york state drivers license birth date person booth rude also think could read left bad taste pittsburg need fo revise signs
A BIG FAT DISAPPOINTMENT I concerned future Port Authority, Pittsburgh continue bus service know it? Port Authority constantly causes great deal anxiety. I riding bus long I remember. We never car family. Now I starting feel like I've taken bus granted. I license I choose drive...because I work Downtown cost renting parking space Downtown HIGH!!! Anyway Port Authority sum up, hot damn mess. How could I forgotten? I shut bus doors ignorant, rude, nasty bus drivers Twice!!! And happen first time, bus drive wouldn't even apologize me, The bus drivers miserable bunch, right rotten,
I don't understand Pittsburghers routinely put idiocy public transportation system. Port Authority Allegheny County public transportation massive, severe, permanent brain damage. Unreliable, buses routinely don't come heavy commuting times (like you're trying get work time), many drivers assholes, fare doubled decade service cut half. The county refuses fund it. Getting confusing. When pay confusing. The schedules hard read. The service isn't frequent enough. The subway system goes one neighborhood downtown. This horrible it's one main things keeping Pittsburgh great city be. Call center people sometimes rude mostly unresponsive. What else? The buses smell like urine. Sucks, sucks, sucks. I live 3 miles downtown I commute walking every day, from, Port Authority Allegheny County buses suck bad.
Port Authority sucks! They worst transportation service ever Pittsburgh. Buses never time, either early, late, buses crowded bus drivers never anything it! THey don't extra bus, short bus drivers, it's busy events, games, parades, buses full people don't drive depend buses try get going, wait like whole hour next bus come! They also cut back bus services lay bus drivers. Pathetic!!!! ALSO MOST OF THE BUS DRIVERS ARE PLAIN RUDE AND COMPLAINING TO PORT AUTHORITY DOES NO GOOD! WHY DO THESE IDIOTS STILL HAVE JOBS IF THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO TREAT CUSTOMERS? VERY INCONVENIENT! IF I HAD A CAR, I WOULDNT HAVE TO DEPEND ON PORT AUTHORITY BUSES!!! I rather stuck traffic trapped crowded bus bunch smelly idiot rude people give room stand, especially much room people hog seats. Pittsburgh known worst transportation! They reimburse time waste give free ride!
Port Authority Allegheny County employs very, bad drivers. A driver deliberately cut minutes ago Liberty Avenue downtown. Further, driver express sorry cutting forcing swerve oncoming traffic. The driver middle-aged man. He driving G2 bus. The bus number 5525. I call Port Authority minutes lodge complaint; however, I wanted lodge two reasons. First, complaint bears Port Authority's ability keep riders safe (because driver almost caused accident, could resulted injuries riders bus). Second, driver causes accident future, I hope complaint help injured parties make case negligent retention negligent supervision Port Authority.
As car-less denizen PGH, I rely PAT buses get Point A Point B. Living Oakland, PAT offers buses many places I need go (downtown, grocery store, airport, etc.). As PITT employee, price (free) right. Having said this, I several gripes: 1.) Buses almost never run time, there's way know next one coming asking people bus stop long they've waiting. Come on, it's 2014--a GPS-enabled device every bus check see is, SMS alert system. Singapore buses 2010! 2.) Some drivers surly downright ignorant. More once, bus passed waiting stop apparent reason, failed hold 5-10 s. I huffed puffed catch it. For whatever reason, outbound 28X seems especially problematic. True story: Last time I rode it, driver didn't know going, ended crossing Liberty Bridge, despite pax telling wasn't route. To make matters worse, last 28X night, due detour, I didn't get home 1am. 3.) Regardless route ride, clientele bit sketch. Some drivers also let homeless people ride without paying/a voucher pity. On one occasion, pax regaled bus nonsensical poetry (not sure influence mentally incapacitated...), driver nada (though amusing). 4.) The system pay nonsensical. Despite terminal degree lived PGH 3 years, I still haven't figured out, rely cues bus driver. While I understand reason behind (the free zone downtown), must less confusing solution. Get it! 5.) For don't PITT CMU pass, fares--including monthly passes--are expensive ($2.50 per trip). Pro Tip: For round trip, pay first leg, ask transfer use second leg--this shaves $1.50 fare. 6.) Even Oakland, route options better areas city, direct buses areas I'd like visit (e.g., Strip). Also, P1 downtown, buses serving East Busway run rush hour weekdays, even P1 runs hourly rush hour. I've ridden public transit cities, size, PGH better system lower fares. For starters, T (light rail) expanded run east-west along busways, given it's currently line nowhere.
How port authority money build pointless pass east liberty busway, can't update online system smart phones able determine bus located at? I waited two hours today freeZing cold get work. Had call cold out!
I cannot stand Port Authority yet I'm avid user b/c I hate driving especially rush hour. Can degrees hate...well apparently contest Port Authority wins marginally - gets 2 stars rather 1. I clarify, I hate bus system don't mind trolley "T". But unfortunately, I've destined live area bus trasport I've trying manage I'm fed constant delays no-shows bus I try take city. I option take G3 28X get city reasonable amount time. There bus options research take well hour get city Robinson area. The G3 28X "express" options. The G3 reliable experience timings bit inconvenient. They operate 5 AM something little 8 AM resume around 3:00 PM 7:00 PM weekdays only. So I need get bus 8:00 AM 3:00 PM option I rely 28X. The 28X experience constantly delayed does't show I make use schedule TrueTime app. You would think bus runs every 30 minutes could get together show least within 5-10 minutes it's supposed scheduled time. On days, I wait 20 minutes sometimes even 40 minutes time I'm one first stops! I wish better transit option Pittsburgh area infrastrucure city (roads, parking, etc.) improved...I feel like I'm stuck rock hard place.
The Port Authority runs convoluted inconsistent transit network - I hate Uber's business model, there's good reason services like found hold Pittsburgh. The buses stop running regularly 10:30-11:30 weeknights around midnight weekends, buses require pay exiting, bizarre; timetables weekends sometimes feature forty-five-minute gaps buses T serves South Hills. In general, I'm disappointed new resident without car discovered Pittsburgh car-centric city many ways Port Authority could improved expanded. As I write I'm half hour late work due late 28x - need somewhere, leave 90min advance risk unpunctual buses.

The Pittsburgh bus system finally real time tracking. Be sure download one apps (PAT Realtime Tracker Transit), figure buses are. For city cold often bad weather, much needed feature. Hope bus drivers use feature improve spacing prevent bunching.
They say get one chance make first impression. The airport good place it. PAT gets one entire star for: * Not showing accordance posted schedule * Lacking clue missing bus * Ornery driver finally arrived, discharged passengers, refused board refugees waiting airport bus stop, without even word explanation * Refusing refund fare paid service * Wasting hour time. Fact: My connecting flight St. Louis took less time trip airport bus stop Oakland. Big league cities need big league transportation. Get game, PAT.
4.5 stars???? Really????? Based what? The food okay, great; standard breakfast diner fare. The staff friendly. The prices right get. What I found annoying uncomfortable seating. The seats counter torn tilting base. The booths fast-food style: hard tight. It's designed seating uncomfortable wouldn't linger.
My heart still trying get back regular running mode.. The portions place insane. Food delicious, decor looks like dirty truck stop. The omelets INSANE, bigger head.. speaking things bigger head.. Sausage patties fact large. Service you'd expect, pretty good overworked crew.
Clearly based reviews, I try daylight hours. We went long night out, landing around 2:30. I've plenty late night places, after-hour bars, etc, I've never scared I Jo-jo's. 2 fights broke there. First group guys, girlfriends. Then guy next table threw ground -some splashing leg. Then heard police sirens fights escalating - bolted. Maybe rare experience? Anyway - I won't heading back anytime soon!
The store small, carries specialties difficult find Pittsburgh. I particularly excited find middle eastern chili sauce chocolate covered Turkish delights.
This worst service I ever gotten, employee airport avis center stole money us. We trying rent car airport thought price expensive, asked swipe card confirmed wanted price leave swipes card. And happened 3500$ short. Also prices really bad here, one car price insurance 3500$ enterprise 1700$. We still haven't gotten money back money middle nowhere Pennsylvania. Avis customer service says wait 72 hours. Thanks starving us avis making us sleep cars. Never go here.
I rented car location drop point. I returned car parking garage instructed went front desk. I signed paper work returned keys. About 4 days later I received awful phone call I accused causeing damage vehicle. I became angry. I called location back accused causing "concrete" damage vehicle. I asked lady viewed cameras parking garage replied, "We don't cameras." The lady wanted write report stateing I hadn't run anything. When I asked would happen I didn't waste time customer writing report replied, we'll do. I never ever use company recomend anyone else, worst experience customer service ever!
Worst customer service place. I chose location return. And minute late return charged full hour rate. Which almost much daily rate. No grace period understanding all. Then staff repeatedly said like parrot "call corporate". She useless TSA agent. And ask customer go car perform work. I run car record mileage her. Why didn't I get paid then?
We made trip Pittsburgh month back friend mine insisted get sandwich Primanti's. It everything I'd hoped for. I roast beef. It topped slaw fries I threw little hot sauce there. Wash Iron City.
I town Pittsburgh, I told place go get PA experience. The meal started pretty well $2 Yuenglings amazing chili, cheese, sour cream bacon fries. However, things took turn worse famous sandwiches came out. Two us turkey one colossal fish. I thought turkey slimy tasted weird. The fries added almost flavor sandwich, cole slaw gross. The bread terrible, overall, sandwich made nauseous. Totally worth it, unless go fries drinks.
Primanti's sandwiches pretty much sum Pittsburgh many ways: big, over-the-top, tasteless, unhealthy. What could ask for? Unfortunately, place pretty dirty. Make sure flies land food. It seems like Pittsburgh natives love place, fine. Its food certainly unique. However, you're Pittsburgh, there's good chance you'll walk away rather bland taste mouth. By way, pronounce "t" Primanti. It really irks native Pittsburghers. It's pronounced "Primanny." Unfortunately, I learned hard way.
I Pittsburgh 4th July weekend check fireworks I visited Market Sq. location 4th, place wasn't really packed I arrived. I needed feed myself, wife two kids. I ordered hot sausage cheese myself, black angus top sirlion cheese wife split order 6 chicken fingers kids (it comes fries, deal!). After I placed order I waited bar unfortunately death Steve Mcnair started air :-(. The bar quickly filled I placed order. The sandwiches took little prepare quick I've heard are. I got order usual fashion I checked it. No chicken finger fries....bummer. I go back cashier/bartender/cook asked order asks cook shrugs like "I dunno" , grabs new chicken fingers tosses fryer I wait even longer food. I planning take go eat hotel free parking front. My hotel airport I wanted sandwiches fresh possible I get full experience. The chicken fingers took even longer prepare I waiting hoping food doesn't get cold. Finally, awhile watching news order ready I dash drive back hotel. First let say kids INHALED chicken fingers like I never seen tried chicken fingers everywhere. The fries didn't care much. I ate half sandwich longer hot wasn't bad, wife didn't really care since amount steak skimpy. We would definitely try Primanti's ones got time eat location fresh another complaint wife ingredients didn't seem fresh. I cross Primanti's list things da 'burgh. Now I get fear heights ride inclines.
The food OK. Soggy french fries greasy cheese steak pattie. The service awful, noise, helpful newcomer Primantis Pittsburgh.
Update. Went different location. Non-smoking location. Got pastrami time instead bland sausage. Added fried egg sandwich well. I forgot huge thing was. I could eat half. I fan Primanti's.
We ate Primanti Bros based reviews Yelp, hoping get real taste Pittsburgh. What I ordered sandwich labeled Pittsburgher Cheese Steak. What I got inedible slab overcooked mystery meat, cole slaw, mediocre fries, white bread. The sandwich small, I ate 1/2 anyway, I pretty big appetite. I recently ate 20 oz cheeseburger local burger joint. I truly shocked. That worst meat I seen since Junior High School. We would much better Burger King. Luckily nice lunch Salim's wash taste junk mouths.
Worst sandwich Earth. I'd rather eat dead whore. Please...never come here.
Primanti Bros basically heart yinzers Pittsburgh. However, I take primanti bros doses. Their big ass sandwiches make feel like I dont need eat rest week. Sometimes I love sometimes I hate it. Either way nice place sit back, relax, enjoy nice cold beer friends. My complaint particular primanti bros market square people generates. Anywhere hookers crackheads. I several times atleast 4 5 times I watched someone get kicked something illegal. My advice is, can, go primantis day lunch dont go night. If go one strip district southside 17th street.
GROSS!!! Many people told go I totally disappointed! It bland, coleslaw tangy (and contained cabbage) meat scary! Good thing it's super cheap. Do NOT get cheese-steak sandwich go even though says #2 best seller, it's awful! Okay service... Everyone seemed like hated job. Someone table asked tomatoes add onions course got tomatoes onions. Maybe I ordered wrong thing maybe bad day... Who knows.
I usually go Primanti Brothers Strip District location pretty similar, reduced operating hours. (Their Strip District location open 24/7.) I like sandwiches. It seems Pittsburgh place I find sandwiches stuffed fries coleslaw. It's copious amount food lot money Primanti compares favorably value restaurants Pittsburgh downtown area. Only problem I see restroom bit dingy flight stairs, may difficult disability.
Everyone knows go Pittsburgh, go Primanti Bros. (My friends I town Pirates/Phillies game, PNC Park Primanti Bros packed entire game.) We visited Market Square location, eat patio, it's fun place hang drink Iron City beers. I got Black Angus Sandwich. It quite large, cut half, brought piece wax paper. As turned out, I'm pretty sure wax paper would tasted better. It really, really, good. I eat first half, bread tasteless, I thought maybe would better I ate half piece piece. The coleslaw OK, french fries awful, little bit actual meat little taste. We little contact employees, cab driver told us young couple dared ask sandwich another Primanti Bros without coleslaw, treated really rudely. Because know, people rude hilarious. So I guess want authentic Pittsburgh experience go here. But want actual decent food, avoid costs
A Pittsburgh tradition like other. Unhealthy food served wax paper... Gotta twice year!
My family always wanted try Primanti. What huge disappointment Anchor drive one. The pizza served mound burnt ashes bottom. Not little, teaspoons it, over. The ovens cleaned. I ordered fish sandwich came cold, soppy mess oil bread chunk coleslaw core inedible. My sons better. The waitress saw taken one bite asked wanted take home. We said 'no way.' She didn't flinch didn't care. I don't care ever go back tell friends avoid. In Philly, they'd business heartbeat. It also dirty, noisy unkempt premises.
The fries 'slaw piled sandwiches cool local niche, I'd say overall quality sandwiches average otherwise.
After sitting ignored 25 minutes left!
I'm others - lover Primanti Bros. Sandwiches fine (I ordered turkey cheese) service horrible. Rude, arrogant, nasty. Plus last time broom taken floors? (I'm reviewing Monroeville one here).
I still trying figure transport sandwiches back plane.....There something Pittsburgh traditional comfort food! I addicted husband.
Based I've read yelp, I tried Pastrami. The cole slaw, fries, meat, italian bread came together really HUGE sandwhich really good reasons. Flavor, texture, quantity, presentation. Ordered couple Yuenglings wash down...not bad.
Primanti Bros sammich everything I expected be...and I inhaled it! That's I'll say.
Wildly overrated. I compare Pat's Geno's Philly, good drunk, drunk. I went Pitt 4 years I say I never understood Primantis hype. I dont know get famous putting fries sandwich fries suck. They soggy tasteless, maybe worst I've ever had. I say coleslaw pretty good, I'm usually coleslaw guy, doesnt make shortcomings. Half sandwich falls eating. The "cheesesteak" might tasteless sandwich ever. You use whole bottle hot sauce get little flavor. Primantis sucks...go Fatheads Southside Uncle Sam's Oakland.
I realize it's sandwich shop I dared order salad - menu limited - put something you're going right? Ordered grilled chicken salad, take out. Got back hotel found pile tasteless, cold french fries it...so cold never melted shredded orange cheese-food underneath them. Also salt ketchup included, even I DID want eat stone cold, unseasoned fries, would suck. The balsamic dressing I ordered replaced (fake) raspberry vinaigrette, repulsive required trip way back restaurant get correct dressing, of. Would nice asked, since Italian hand - seems like closer match. The iceberg lettuce, olive, tomato salad, oh yeah, bit chicken too, okay I scraped orange congealed "cheese" off. That smokers hanging around place (and Pittsburgh general), I would say place totally over-rated dump.
ALWAYS first stop back Burgh. Folks need lighten -- sandwich joint. Not fine dining. Cold, cheap beer sammies fries slaw -- way since 1930s. Thats advertise that's deliver -- every time. Cap cheese frosty IC Light -- heaven.
I respect Primanti's following have, I don't like sandwiches much. I probably year b/c someone town wants go there. Sometimes I forget much I don't like sandwiches one time year. Sorta perceive Holidays joyous time reality hits realize that's it's completely overrated. I usually get Cappicola Cheese sandwich it's alot salty meat, bland fries, mild cole slaw, cheese completely hidden ingredients two slices bread. Maybe Primanti's make secret sauce b/c it's always damn dry. I think I need learn lesson stop going there. I would given 2 stars seems like Pittsburgh staple I didn't heart dock stars. See, Pittsburgh girl still gives props roots!
If pass Pittsburgh place must visit. Their specialty sandwich like other. They're little short conversation I guess that's part packaged deal. If I ever moved Pittsburgh I'd move near one locations ; )
This one hyped restaurant I ever to. I know it's Pittsburgh legend. I several times every time say myself, I won't going back. I go dragged coworkers. The restaurant always packed, service slow get get drink refill cashier. Yes it's unique fries cole slaw sandwiches, sandwiches horrible. Burnt Roast Beef poor quality cheese steaks don't cut me.
Subway calls line folks "sandwich artists." If people considered artists, cooks Primanti Bros friggin' Picasso. If you've never sat grill, should, see action. On busy lunch day, it's uncommon 15 things going once, keep track what's via...broken french fries. I've never seen heard get anything wrong, either! While I wouldn't call chefs, menu end day simple, definitely solid skill set griddle. If you've never Primaniti's, tips seasoned veteran. Tip 1: Always get fried egg. Always. On everything. Tip 2: Pick bottle hot sauce sploosh fries...those complaining bland fries definitely need try hot sauce technique, makes definite difference. Tip 3: The "cheesesteak" sucks travesty people encouraged order abomination, compared many items deliciousness menu. Tip 4: I'm big fan capicola (with egg) colossal fish. The fish huge, feel like fat kid finish it. Tip 5: A 23oz "Iron" like $4. Get one talk like Yinzer complete experience. The Market Square location good original Strip. Oakland meh, Southside comes third book. I haven't others. If you're coming town though, fit ill.
Always love Primanti's I Central Pittsburgh area, I went lunch. It rush wasn't busy waitresses acted like was. I told sit myself, cool since I wanted sit outside. But two waitresses kept coming going without even looking me. Finally third came took order. I got usual.... pastrami, extra cheese, tomato, add egg. When miss "no tomato"? I got sammich (eventually) tomato. I immediately wanted send back waitress gone MIA. She disappeared again. I waited long I could never came back. I finally carried sloppy tomato seed-covered bread back restaurant told cook I needed new piece bread. He gave funny look, I ate sammich, five minutes later waitress finally showed up. Until missing. I annoyed, came back refill drink. A minutes later I needed bill, guess what, gone again! I walk inside get check pay it. I really annoyed. Love Primantis Market Square one terrible service.
ate one North Versailles. floor filty, young kids running place, poor service, poorly made sandwich, bad overall. The manager duty. I wont back. thanks
it's close 5 years since i've primanti's, disgusted knock chicago (i'm talking Lucky's).. come back give props primanti's. don't remember ordered, remember ordering two sandwiches come back 4 hours later order another. remember monstrosity sandwich w/o skimping meats w/ good ratio meats, fries, slaw.
Prior writing review Primanti Bros., I put helmet, tooth guard, started car prepared run away angry hordes Pittsburghers read review...Why ask? Get ready it....deep breath... I...don't...like...Primantis... Gasp! Choke! Faint! Yes, yes, I know. As born bred Pittsburgher, I committing blasphemy admitting I don't like Primantis. I don't like sandwiches, I don't like nachos, I don't like soups, salads, wings fries. I find whole idea sandwich containing 3,000 calories worth Italian bread, cole slaw, meat, fries top. The fries soggy mess, slaw much vinegar, meats cheap, bread is...well bread actually ok. I know it's Pittsburgh institution even served pragmatic purpose back day, it's kitsch gets city featured Food Network occasion. I've eaten numerous times done Pittsburgh duty taking towners (in)famous Primanti's, always caveat that, "It's good." usually apology afterward. So it. I feel like giant weight lifted shoulders. I longer carry around terrible, terrible secret.
So Pittsburgh instiitution?? Am underwhelmed. After waiting 20 minutes sandwiches (in end still sandwiches), came cold - I'm talking meat, lettuce, tomatoes - everything cold including fries. What disappointment. Head DiBellas - much better service, subs sandwiches.
Previous reviews said well: Lackluster, tasteless food. Ate Primanti Bros group friends Pittsburgh; heard 'Man vs. Food' assured Pittsburgh institution. The sandwiches large pricing fine ($6-$9), get sloppy sandwich food service-grade meat topped lukewarm fries. Good theory, bland execution; it's lot calories without accompanying flavor. We also terrible service Market Square location; I'll chalk fluke. The patio seating Market Square location wonderful sunny day, started rain actually retracted awning, explaining wasn't designed get wet --but apparently customers are. The legacy infamy might tempt eat here, take money elsewhere buy good-tasting food instead kitsch.
There basically cheese "cheese combo sandwich", fries gross, waitress nasty us.
Boring sandwich. Period. I fell "hype" filling $7 bucks, satisfy craving...I corned beef.
I think I made mistake coming sober. Primanti's great you've few. Oddly, location closes midnight it's late night food without late night hours. This location much smaller others. There's good way get group 8+ people together here. It's downtown near offices doesn't seem suit after-work get together well. The food still decent value that's going it.
If live Pittsburgh, don't know Primanti's....then I don't know tell you. If you're visiting Pittsburgh, it's rite passage sorts try one classic sandwiches. I always bring visitors they're usually satisfied. Meat+fries+coleslaw+Italian bread. It's fancy food, it's healthy food, it's yummy food. My favorites kielbasa capicola. Also can't go wrong classic steak. Pro tip: Hot sauce. Confession: I don't like coleslaw, I always order without. I always get hard time staff, always anyways. Locations one Market Square include Strip, Oakland, South Side, stadium, smattering throughout suburbs.
Well, finally happened: I give place single star. And kills place I gave Primanti's. I'm awful Pittsburgher. I don't give low ratings easily often, believe me: place pushed buttons earn awful review. In fact, single star earned place cleaner comfy Primanti places I've too. It kind old diner feeling I liked that. Alas, that's I liked. So, low score? Well: The service terrible. After spending twenty minutes sitting without anyone coming refill water ask actual order - note, place almost completely empty - I went register ask something eat, I'd started think I watching couple people (in hindsight, I probably misinterpreted actions, mistake excuse happened next). My waiter looked went, "Don't get concept restaurant? Haven't restaurants, like, ever? Sit back I'll take order." And even joking manner made feel like I could smile mistake - guy condescending, rude, arrogant person. It unbelievable. Utterly, totally unbelievable. If I hadn't met company night, I would walked right then. To make matters worse, good night order anything Primanti's. The coleslaw way sweet far much it, fries bland texture all, barely meat sandwich all. The result? A big pile carbs really didn't taste great first bites, rather delicious sandwich. Before kill me, please note: I LIKED meal Mt. Lebanon's Primanti location. They also diverse menu, always bonus - I like options. I think future, I stick location local chain, even busy night I managed get food decent amount time. I certainly coming downtown location I spot previous, downright awful waiter working again.
We obligatory Primanti Bros stop recent first visit Pittsburgh. We understand it's novelty fries everything. But they're seasoned well crisp...what's point? When place gets talked much, can't help big expectations. We disappointed... Here's thing, sit restaurant table filthy, menus food them, bring drinks Solo cups...Without doubt, I still college needed nurse hangover, would probably go-to place. My husband ordered Italian Sausage, obscenely big, good flavor, fries mush flavorless. Luckily, ordered additional side slaw, that's truly made sandwich, tasty. We also ordered "vegetarian" soup good, I ordered chix salad MASSIVE sandwich fries slaw calling me. Little I know, gimmick fries everything meant fries everything....including salad. It really gross tasteless grease piles salad I couldn't even eat. Although dining there, salad came plastic to-go box pre-packaged dressing packet. The chicken like tasteless rubber. We checked "Primanti Bros" box, won't back.
I can't life figure hype. I warned others mainly tourists eat. But I'm tourist here, wanted try it. It sandwich mostly slaw fries. The thick white bread dry boring; crusty. The fries sandwich overpowered taste! So I dismantled it. When rude server asked I liked it, I honest. He gave big time attitude commented I took apart. I told him, I took apart horrible sandwich (the pastrami, way). And that, sir, got $0.35 tip! (never give zero tip, they'll think forgot, always leave small amount change) If put hot sauce sandwich make palatable, bother? (The server, walked away, told it's really good hot sauce, Tabasco, I don't like, way!) They left tomato supposedly comes sandwich! Of 4 staff members I came contact with, 1 rude, unfriendly uncaring. One constantly walked trash blown outdoor tables without picking up. The fries good. Nope, won't back.
Disappointed, big time. Local info lauds place institution. I say: pass. The sandwich soggy, bland, all-around good. I didn't get sick it, that's bonus. Choose wisely. Go Meat & Potatoes instead, order sandwich there.
I've heard hype wanted try it. Tonight second attempt here. First time, new girl grill apologized 10 minutes, 15 I walked. Not even acknowledgement wait staff. Tonight, waiter seemed mad I didn't know I wanted order. After I explained I'd never there, brought menu proceeded ignore 10 minutes. I walked again. No tries here. Maybe I'm something wrong? Haha.
If like sandwiches french fries piled them, go it. But good sandwich needs nonsense like that. These good sandwiches begin adding soggy fries doesn't help. Not mention bread fresh thick, bland wonder-bready thing. I appreciate they're aiming customers like me. Big sloppy sandwiches fun lot people I hate party pooper, I don't think quality there.
I really looking forward huge tasty sandwich greatly disappointed! Everything bland, nothing seasoning, even basic salt. Soggy fries, tasteless meat, average coleslaw white bread trying double Italian bread. Save time, money calories go Wendy's instead.
This place holds nostalgic appeal people born raised Pittsburgh grew eating here. If experience looking for, please visit. If you're looking tasty meal, go somewhere else. 5 stars history, 0 food quality flavor.
Returned Pittsburgh, Ate Primanti 2nd time: I stand decision: Pass.
Bread, slaw, tomato, fries, small piece overcooked fish piled together. Warm yiengling mediocre service. Aweful
Had high hopes place visit Pittsburgh. The presentation sandwiches making mouth water, there's lot good things going ingredients...In theory, should've resulted bold flavor taste explosion, I found severely let bland ingredients piled high front me. The pastrami terrible, coleslaw weak, fries bland, dry, flavorless. Still bummed, guess place I tourist draw legit sandwich shop.
Primanti Bros dirty guilty pleasure I give year. Most times, towners ask local spot eat, I'm one actually pushes AWAY defacto Burgh tradition. Don't get wrong, Primanti's isn't bad, isn't exactly great either. Typically I end smothering mine hot sauce salt/pepper get flavor onto otherwise bland sandwiches. With said, every awhile, I get odd, insatiable craving cap egg sandwich (w/ onion)... I cave temptation, it's oddly satisfying. On experience front, Primanti's definitely one kind. I don't know anywhere else get burly bartenders slam mess sandwich wax paper table (something suburban restaurants fail provide). If you're going go, I highly suggest going either original Strip, or, don't feel like waiting line busy times, Market Square location.
Worst service ever. The waitress I use term loosely rolled eyes question ordering yelled someone table asking coleslaw side. Then come back ask orders got mad repeated coleslaw since didn't repeat back. When brought food slammed food shouted name one sandwiches um asking sandwich job remember anyways. I'm glad I don't live Pittsburgh worry avoiding place.
Stopped two times weekend I area again). Get egg thrown mix sandwich. Tried pittsburgher cheesesteak, I expecting regular burger patty sliced steak, ended weird patty almost like meatloaf (not burger). Not sure I'd order again. Pastrami cheese still good. Wish egg came little runny.
This overrated place bragged Pittsburgh. My first visit one South Hills. Waited 90 mins 4 sandwiches. The coleslaw gross I'm fan coleslaw. Due 90 min wait I given gift card I used one Market Square. This time I got grilled chicken salad. If like chewing rubber bands, I recommend it. It absolute worst salad I've ever had, screw salad? The chicken tasteless rubbery. Got go girl took order phone rude rushed equally rude I picked up. She assumed knew name order handed random bag food. I told I missing sandwich tossed another bag without saying word. I NEVER go back locations. I'd rather eat ham sandwich Sheetz. At least I get without attitude. If friends coming visit town, take anywhere here. And say go original one Strip, thanks, it's food. If looking awesome sandwich go Schmitz Old World Deli Greenfield.
Had try Pittsburgh. Ate first half sandwich slaw & fries time I got second half I took fries cold. I pastrami & asked extra cheese. Didn't get extra cheese. Feel like sandwiches missing something. Might good thousand island dressing "secret sauce". Underwhelmed still recommend trying least experience. Market square location confusing seat wasn't clear.
Service sucked big time Monday, June 9, Primanti's Market Square. It took half hour wife get cheese steak place wasn't even crowded. Missed first inning Pirates game result. Boo!
Highly disappointing. While sandwich unique totally cooked seasoned. No flavor
Great food overall locations! Go another location eat though. The Market Square location horrible service I've ever experienced. Horrible!
I recommended friend place cross Pittsburgh "bucket list". I ended getting Pittsburger - met expectations, average begin with. I'd definitely come back again.
Absolutely horrible! Frozen meat patty dog food like taste texture P'burgher. Seriously place survive? Read Sarah F. review mirrored experience strip district location. Will never return location!
Service bad. Server walked away done ordering someone got attention return 5 minutes later clarify wrong. We didn't see good 20 minutes go bar refills. She take one cups refill it, sat bar left 10 minutes, finally saw ask grab bar. Highly disappointing Philly cheesesteak!! The meat frozen Salisbury steak TV dinner!! French fries good.
I cheeseburger decent. I'm fan coleslaw made burger little dry taking off. I'll give something else try next time I town.
I famous Pitts-Burger disgusting! The reason I'm giving two stars bread. The bread super soft tasty meat gross cole slaw bitter. I don't see hype about!
customer service always nice dont think place little over-rated? Their 'Almost Famous Sandwitches' need hard work get famous. Basically, place like Dr. Pepper soda. People crazy thing tastes extremely ridiculous.
Draft Belgian beer Mason Dixon dog.
Beer cave!!
I don't understand hype D's, although I guess beer selection *does* rule. If selection drives decision-making, definitely head over. However, you'd like receive anything slow, resentful service waitstaff, food anything sub-par, head without stopping. I've lived Forbes D's 3 yrs, walk friends lot summer early fall. I'm also former bartender waitress, I say experience certainty I've received downright terrible service 80% times I've been. Once, friend I stopped lunch kids ended waiting check 18 minutes we'd asked receive it. We fuming, waitress looked annoyed kept ignoring us chat buddy. Another time, husband I came 15 minutes ordering deadline, watched waitress approach table exactly cut-off time. She proudly announced could longer order food (we wanted pretzels, god's sake). Food pretty lackluster, although it's nice touch veggie dogs. Upstairs, expect level service, douchy element annoyed resentment bartender, along even douchy-ier clientele. I know D's favorite neighborhood place, I'm tired abuse waitstaff look annoyed I'm even there. If once-in-a-while occurrence, I'd forgiving, 3 years long enough judge.
One favorites it's convenient, there's awful lot like. My favorite dishes Big Ben Hot Dog Balboa Chicken Sandwich, beer selection fantastic. We've also started get pizzas here, they're quite good.
Local rootbeer always win, hotdogs pizza disappointment. The jerk chicken wings, hand...inedible. Stick dogs za, won't sorry.
Had scorpion dog Mac cheese. It made day.
I tried go second time today. I say tried I sat bar 7 mins 3 people walking around behind one even acknowledging I there. I ended going next door The Map Room lunch. The first time I gone I server come take order, kitchen guy ran out, one ever came back 45 mins. I went counter check thought I wouldn't give another go. Well, can't say I didn't try. I barbeque chicken pizza first time wasn't bad, place I'd make go pizza place.
I hate agree poor reviews branch, definitely far best Eagle city. I'll say upfront I never felt unsafe three times I here. However, quality produce experience pretty poor. The lines always long take forever get through. Furthermore, stuff bakery goodies par. I'd recommend stopping another Giant Eagle can. However, location DOES Redbox, nice.
I've lot bad experiences store. The employees rude much I expect roll eyes I get deli meat. Lines long, there's always crowd people hanging front begging money, cigarettes, trying sell food stamps. I filed complaint corporate store I contacted manager. I say, manager really, sincerely cares store customer experience. I talked 20 minutes polite friendly. His name Mr. Youngblood, urges ask manager you're bad experience. Produce selection terrible, meat counter store, it's feels dirty. This grocery store north side, it's easy "just go somewhere else" sometimes get work, don't want drive 10 minutes go Kuhns mcknight.
Such shame place. I moved couple months ago wasn't sure neighborhood yet, Giant Eagle grocery store around. I've I never, ever go again, even though it's literally 2 minute walk away me. I harassed parking lot shabby, scary people looked like belonged mental institution, toothless scary freaks corner beg money cigarettes, saw number must've drug deals, overall I felt unsafe. The store seemed really outdated stinky. I don't know stink emanating customers food. Can't something done this? Like, security guards police officer monitor area? It's really bad allow drug deals, sex offenders, scary people linger parking lot. I realize every city "characters", every potential customer's safety much jeopardized allowing shit carry nothing it. Get together, Giant Eagle.
It smells funky here. On positive note, usualy fully stocked INDOOR redbox. My debit card numbers hacked skimmer Shadyside Get Go. Every last dollar spent 1 hour Bed Bath & Beyond barely use redbox.. indoor location like one. The skimming still happen feel little ease. Oh check cashing system hit miss. Its different GE's use system. The last two times here, system declined bobbys check. Waste time. I dont even bother coming anymore. All bad news.
Went store today worse usual . Jitneys parked handicapped parking spaces raining. The one guy walking back car next pulled keys pocket baggie corner filled brown stuff fell right front me. I seen pocket something man sits driveway exit. He pick really fast. Then I saw young man tie store go guy selling stuff shook hands laughing yacking This middle day. I'm scared shop dark.
If I could give place Zero stars I would. There never enough lanes open, food shelves may may expired cashiers downright miserable. I won't even get shenanigans going parking lot. I left closed lane I already line someone could take smoke break, meanwhile line way pharmacy. The bright spot guys bag groceries always super friendly. I wish north side another option don't. Giant Eagle ashamed establishment.
So I take 501's #pfennigs cleaners North Dide Pittsburgh way I 6 years. Not every week I know it's time get dry cleaned. I took 5 6 pairs.....3 I still wear, 2 I can't even button up. I knew something different happened. They shrunk terribly I felt right ask reimburse jeans. The owner Mr. Pfennig, gets phone I called said......whatever.....excuse I scream...... I work department saves customers leaving financial issues, service issues reps rude customers us less 6 years I customer cleaners. If I said whatever customer likely would get escalated, customer would disconnect service new guidelines.....fired I would be. It gets better......I walk cleaners speak show work insulted Me. Pfennig said well wife doesn't remember brought 4th January...it's new year maybe body changed. If I 18 I would beat ass that. Like goes 38's 42's 7 days? I even showed size jeans done correctly still would visually acknowledge cleaners shrunk clothes! I told 2 pics, hashtag Twitter would fix this. It's new day age someone supports small business treated talked way longer acceptable. The sad part I would continued customer reimbursed $90 2 pair 501's I purchased sale Macy's. I see one thing stands reviews owners lack customer service skills. I never give another penny money I spend going elsewhere worth it. #badcleaners
Horrible customer service! Owner takes responsibility ruining clothing. He blame everyone else apologizing. I may highest paying customer I deserved least apology.
Get Peanutzz!! We decided whim try something different bar place indeed was. Saturdays cover DJ $3. This didn't seem bad coming cities covers $15 $20 higher I feel like place could use money. Peanutz small venue. The bar area narrow cramped left dark area DJ along tables stairs bathroom. If weren't bar people sitting tables starring DJ you... Maybe one two people dancing music. I thought music awesome though - mix old school underground hip hop. Beers cheap - I think paid $5 three draft beers. Woot!! However folks smoking bathrooms gross. My jacket took days air smell smoke. I won't returning even Peanutz offered peanuts.
I pretty easygoing guy. I would've overlooked fact(s) that: 1. Jim Beam bourbon. 2. For reason two drinks came $9.90.* 3. Even 10 people bar, music absolutely deafening. 4. You charge $3 cover discernible reason. 5. Rolling blunts apparently kosher inside bar, sharing, much. However, I can't let slide: claw machine BULLSHIT. That weakest claw time, there's chance EVER picking anything cage. I feel violated, I want dollar back. ___________ *I think that's sort weird PA tax thing.
Our bartender didn't know pint pour beer
Unfortunately, Steve's closed. No indication moving anywhere, it's gone. So sad. Thought best pgh price.
It's hard beat mani pedi $35. I wished open later 6:30. Just don't inspect salon thoroughly. Service quick satisfactory. I likely return.
The worst customer service ever!!!!!!! When I told stylist design I wanted, proceeded say stat wouldn't look right shorter nail. offered Freestyle design nails horrible I like all. I told I change mind want design got attitude I asked money back design. She couldn't talk customers predicament comparing situation one restaurant. I never ever come back establishment poor work rude disrespectful.
I normally don't I'm disappointed. If care natural nails, stay away place. The polish soaked filed polish last least two/three weeks shellac. I done Friday afternoon needed repaired Saturday afternoon.
I don't eat restaurant often. The food okay nasty restaurant let horrible smelling homeless people eat there. There one guy comes restaurant & smells like shits & smells extremely horrible! I'm glad I don't eat restaurant often.
STAY AWAY... We've 3 times past years, time say "let's try again" followed "wish we'd done something else". Reminds movie line "Run away, run far away" Last nite Steelers/Jets last straw. I hope owner general manager reads this. And think health department too. Service mediocre slow. consistently. Waitress ok attitude. After soup starter (good french onion soup) waited waited waited waited mains. Noticing us staring her, waitress stopped by, went kitchen, came back said next. watch said 8:31. Then manager came argued said next, 8:52pm horrible food finally arrived. That's 21 minutes next. In time watched 4 tables turn seated drinks mains check waited main. Manager embarrassed himself. Said busy working food checked would come soon. I told 4 tables turning said didn't. I said I used manage restaurants know customer service ticket times challenged said I didn;t I idea I talking about. What idiot! First rule restaurant business customer always right. Then food arrived. How hard chicken marsala mushrooms, seriously? It two soggy fried chicken tenders deep fryer (not pan sauteed) bowl bowtie pasta shrooms sauce. While sauce marsala it, full sour cream tasted like stroganoff little funny. The Penne ala vodka sauteed canned tomatoes flavor. We hungry ate left. 1 hour later I sick side road dinner still feel really rough morning.
The food good portions large. The service terrible. The servers "too cool," show sort hospitality. No personality spark. I don't know hate working hate serving people. It's puzzling. Why service business bad attitude? I couple times doesn't change. They look blankly, like don't understand saying. I've never staring contest hostess before. It's bizarre. I wonder Xanax...
I feel bad giving place meh review every time I go that's exactly I feel I leave. Atria's one places I've never type memorable service experience food experience matter. I can't say food bad, it's really great either. I say service always so. It's almost don't realize places go; sit restaurant day. On upside busboy's girls hounding table filling water glass taking sip. So you're horse won't go thirsty. Honestly though. better eating park. I mean doesn't love Manny's BBQ?
My husband I Cubs fans flew Pittsburgh see Friday Saturday's Cubs-Pirates game past weekend (7/7 & 8). We got PNC Park around 5 p.m. since gates weren't open decided sit drinks game. We stopped first Atria's. Although one table occupied outside, told weren't going order food (just drink) would give table people, eating food needed it. This RIDICULOUS us left! We paying guests like guests!! Anyway went businesses drank Dominic's. We went Dominic's nights probably spent close $100 AND getting FOOD. Atria's better rethink treat guests....
Ugh, I hate place. People work drag lunch often I would like. The food overpriced. The service snotty slow. I barely get free hour-and-a-half. The food forgettable menu sparse. They're terrible pick-up - even call way ahead, you're made wait, they're surly taking care arrive food. You better lunch northshore pretty much anywhere. Try SoHo Finnegan's instead.
As standard restaurant, Atria's personality: food blah, service eh, nothing really memorable. The patio it's proximity ball parks saving grace. Now, let's talk reserved room bridal shower... We fixed menu group 50 ladies. I understand that. But bride asks tomatoes, server say, "No substitutions!" meanest voice. Lighten up, it's day. I ended taking tomatoes her--and chalked another maid honor duty. The server also kept clearing bride's drinks mingled. This annoying, least paid flat fee drinks, wasn't hugest deal. Overall, server bride's table awful kept treating us like little children. Yes, table bridal party bride's cousins. Yes, 30. But also young professionals ones booked event. The servers waited rest tables containing mothers, aunts, great aunts, grandmothers polite...even near-senile grandmother started yelling bandits. Later, another server apologized behalf bad server mumbled that, "he must period." While Atria's fine glass wine Pirate's game table open outside, I certainly would never book private function.
Located right next PNC Park, decent place get beer grub prior game day. That outdoor seating main perks. Otherwise, food prices worth stop. This place fill game day, avoided Pirates aren't town. It isn't BAD experience. If siting outside view Pittsburgh, can't bad.
I dream. A dream day North Shore ton amazing food options. I hope one day become reality. For now, I think there's smattering okay-ish places lot mediocrity. Maybe it's built crowd. You come game, gotta eat, right? And going eat? Either restaurant outside stadium inside. At point I'd stick inside novelty all. I stopped Atria's game day, came right first pitch going out, wasn't packed least. Our server obviously us, well serving day, pretty short us entire time. Sorry bothered you... The menu incredibly limited around 5 apps, 5 sandwiches 5 main courses. I get they're probably limiting things crowded times, I felt like nothing really called me. I settled going halfies ordering app waiting I inside stadium get "main course." Crab fries, naturally. But that's beside point. The pieorgies ordered okay. They doused Parmesan cheese little overcooked, wasn't worst thing I've ever had. Wasn't best either. I think really turned whole experience. Service, small selection mediocre food. I ordered two buckets crab fries called night!
Here Bucs VICTORY OVER THE CARDS game 3 NLDS, Sunday. Game 4:30, got 2:30. Packed inside out. Can't comment time really hectic one. Ordered Pepsi brisket nachos. AWFUL. Soggy chips, shredded beef drenched sweet generic BBQ sauce, blanket cold congealed cheese spotted jalapeño slices. Not degree room temp. Will give 1 star tasty Pepsi keeping filled.
Went baseball game kids. Limited menu. My husband asked server 3 times water, never received. My Reuben tasted like eating salt stick. Won't go back!
I meeting 3 people there. But I minutes late. Because I wasn't time, refused seat others. Not even get drinks appetizer ordered. So left go place would serve (Dominic's) This place clearly couldn't bothered business, seems like odd way run organization. One star didn't get anything wanted.
When walk buzzing restaurant, you'd expect greeted someone, server, greeter bartender. I went last night, stood around almost 10 minutes, completely ignored. I meeting friends, I decided walk across street grab beer make reservation (using open table) 45 minutes later. Reservation confirmed, beer finished, I walk back over, walk place someone's computer entryway phone. He finishes, make eye contact, nods walks away. My friends come in, wait 10 minutes someone works talk us. I tell reservations, acts like can't happen, it's mistake, says place closed private party. I ask isn't sign door saying 'closed private party', I get ridiculous answer "CEO doesn't like us that". How dumb that: leave system open make reservations don't alert people might going show north shore place closed. The fake sincerity really got me. You know 'private party' sign does? It advertises available private parties, would given hour figure arrangements.
I business dinner firmly seated absolute WORST place I've ever eaten at. -hair food -crab cakes touted amazing, reality disgusting ice cream scoops poor crab mayonnaise -"risotto" uncooked congealed plate. -vegetables gummy soaked oil. Not properly prepped served woody stems. I shocked place turns profit
Before Pirates game stopped get bite. I ordered hamburger fries $13.00. Very disappointed. It took 30 minutes get order. The meat dry falling apart cooked. This tells added "filler", usually bread, stretch meat pump profits. I've juicier meat larger patty Wendy's sixth price. Overall...I would go back Atria's.
Just went restaurant try dinner guy sat us nice waiting 10 minutes sign server husband finally asked could send someone wait us said would. Waited another 5 minutes one showed got left. Awful place, bad I looking forward. We wish would ordered food left.
Stopped specifically pot roast nachos, amazing locations I disappointed discover pot roast. I decided pot pie I've heard good things seemed like good alternative. I wrong. It basically puffed pastry top thin gravy. No chicken. Not even one piece. No potatoes filling except peas. That it. I starving I ate entire thing still hungry afterwards I ate soon I got home. Extremely disappointing.
Went Atrias lunch today. Service slow soup salad. Cup soup $4.99 side salad served large-rimmed bowl $9.99! With coke, lunch $20. Apparently changed menu dramatically increased prices everything. Food ok definitely worth price.
Mediocre best. Went Easter brunch, served coffee can. Waited 45 minutes order chicken piccata also tasted like came can. When I asked bartender/waitress (classy) much longer be, cold un apologetic ridiculous wait. I don't understand place even business. If establishment city would closed. If I'm paying $25 fake Italian food least polite robbery. This place fusion Olive Garden Red Lobster. DO NOT COME HERE. I realized tactic starving customer serving overpriced mediocre food pay light bills. Thanks Atria's, see ya never
Showed Pirate game. Wasn't busy plus. Server took drink order, returned drinks took food order. That last saw him. Someone else came 35 minutes later dropped plates table kept walking. Didn't matter food wasn't correct drinks empty. He managed return soon finished food left check. Guess done? Bathrooms dirty ladies room toilet paper soap. Not good experience. Food OK price. Service terrible won't return.
We took whole family Mother's Day brunch actually awful. We party 11 people. We made reservations ahead time day called say race front restaurant couldn't park front. My 80-year old grandma coming us trouble walking. The restaurant apologized options handicapped parking race going on. My dad parked town wheeled wheelchair across bridge. This worked fine, arrived restaurant us table upstairs. We asked show us elevator. They didn't one. So discussion day handicapped parking earth would seat us upstairs? We wait table set downstairs. Luckily busy. We seated near outside door space wheelchair time ready leave added table outside front door quite bit trouble maneuvering wheelchair get out! We also trouble food. My mom sister don't eat gluten ordered meal potatoes listed side dish. It came kitchen noodles instead potatoes. They said changed menu. But explained waitstaff someone orders meal! We also waited 15 minutes someone even took order. I enjoy meal trouble worth it. We won't back location especially holiday expected go mothers treat expensive meal without issues seating such!
Going downhill......Man, happened place? I used frequent Atria's multiple times week lunch. Usually ruben house salad garlic vin. dressing fries recent construction near PNC Park limited trips. Well time Atria's must made major changes better. I decided take wife kid dinner b/c day nice outdoor seating. Unfortunately waiter par. I sensed little attitude I asked particular dish available let annoyed response slide. Atria's PNC Park streamlined menu Pirate game days. We placed order shortly I wanted make small change apps Sliders Kids menu sliders b/c came fries. Waiter annoyingly rolled eyes. I got left hungry didnt want go another place dinner. I asked problem stated already started order. Well, seems like problem adding fries plate I guess....this interaction left pretty angry anyone knows would likely say I pretty laid back. It difficult get skin. Onto food. House salads wife I pretty standard. I love garlic vinegar dressing. We also got Chicken Ranch flat bread left us disappointed. In pre construction visits one freshest, tastiest meals I sure brought yesterday. It reminded Stouffer's french bread pizza. The sliders fine fries seemed lil cold considering last thing ordered. All though I think days Atria's done. At least PNC Park location sad since I one biggest fans.
I worst experience people last year...i bed bugs apartment (702 james street)...we complaining...and guy called bruce didn't even listen ....when left apartment...i cleaned everything, give deposit back...saying payed somebody clean it(bulshit). And charged taking portraits wall left there...but cause still see portraits east ohio street (layer)...the worst unprofessional real estat company...
I moved Columbus, OH Pittsburgh elated find COSI membership Columbus still usable Children's Museum. While C-bus's children's museum mainly science, Pittsburgh's art going on. My son loves place finally discovered art room. He's super creative likes fact pop apron paint. He even threw clay cup silk screened paper cut outs. They workshop space sew build lil motors. The changing tough art exhibits neat too. On downside, exhibit opens try see early. Simply kids tear shit up. We went opening day Clifford final week props missing kid bite marks Clifford's bones o.0 .
Unfortunately got spend couple hours Black Friday blast. The art room first floor cool It daughter's first art project got take home. We rushed past exhibits/displays/activities got play lights sand going bunce zone. My daughter blast throwing ball around playing magnetic track next door. We definitely schedule longer day next time.
My family I visited museum today. We spent $100 admission & parking 4 adults 3 kids. I disappointed website boasts it's kids ages, yet, kids, ages 9, 11 13 bored. Most activities physically set small children: water tables, art tables, well buttons, controls, etc low kids enjoy without feeling like "babyish". If going advertise ages, I feel need make sure things interest every age, 2 6 year olds. Also, I disappointed signs explaining science behind exhibits. How could say school field trips explanation learned? We back. We feel like money wasted.
I lived pickles college! The downfall delivery time. It always took almost hour half receive food, 10 minutes road. I moved, still delivery distance, terrible experience. I called order total 11 change. I told I'd laying cash. When delivery guy arrived couldn't stop complaining walking steps I would meet downstairs next time. When I handed 20 told me, sorry I don't change. So walked 9 dollar tip terribly late, rude, forgot drink. Good food, rude service phone person. I back since.
Living South Side two years, made. The pizza places around neck woods can't beat. From food prices, couldn't find better. Now live near North Side, it's constant struggle trying find something compares. I'm thinking we've struck out. We decided give Pickles go receiving ad mail. They pizza/hoagie/soda deal less $20. First all, ordering strange. The woman friendly, seemed like different planet. I ended conversation telling I wanted make payment card. She didn't understand. After going back forth, finally understood I wanted pay plastic. "Oh, want pay card?!" Yes. Yes, I do. We usually pick-up (I hate waiting cold pizza), decided get delivered. One lazy nights. It took around 40 minutes I would say average. Wow... we're disappointed. The pizza literally looked like DiGorno frozen supermarket option. The crust super doughy cheese pretty gross. We ordered half sausage/half pepperoni. The sausage strange color, kind color see frozen pizza. I'm usually snob comes pizza, good. The hoagie decent-- little much mayo, really can't screw bread meat. I hate Pepsi two-liter option available, yeah, Pepsi sucked. Definitely won't order again, least tried. The search continues...
This unassuming place North Side - close Mattress Factory. But walking door, hit wall smokiness (the rib kind), know serious place. The owner, Mr Wilson, quiet man words. You 2 choices - ribs chicken. Ribs come small plate, large plate, full rack. Then add sides soda $1 each. I went small group, filled silly ribs sides. Very good sauces. The small plate ribs *very* filling lunch. As others said, decor nothing write home about. But tables. Most business take-out, I definitely returning do.
Don't risk it. Never open need it, unreliable availability products. He offered reserve done cooking I returned time already sold it. I excited try first time won't waste effort future customer service handled. There BBQ places actually food serve.
STEELERS fan since day born!!!! love we're champs but, honestly arent playing like champs lately! Whats that?!!!! Cowher bench Ben truly recovered tramatic experiences year? Batch us well.... im also happy interceptions.......WHY?!!! Ben's good egg, rest up....we still weeks! save ship! know we'll make Playoffs! ill always keep Steelers pride!!!!
No equal. Here go stillers go!!!
This place really busy arrived seemed promising. Some food good others sub-par. Two us ate gyro platter comes with: hummus (watery) pita (store bought) gyro meat (I've never gyro meat like before, ultra thin rubbery texture - also portion small) Greek salad (iceberg sparse toppings much dressing) grape leaves (vegetarian quite good) rice (actually tastiest thing platter - nice lemon chicken broth flavor). Overall food hit miss. The disappointing pita gyro meat. My companion salmon said unremarkable. I think diners come cake eaten almost every person joint. I also agree reviewers, place disgustingly dirty. All patrons walk kitchen use bathroom really gross. The kitchen clean waiter food hands served us. Even homemade wine honey soaked cake won't bring back again.
This place really gross. There one around went in, starving. The food wasn't fresh, dishes dirty, I felt like I going Pan's Labyrinth get bathroom, pretty far away, seemingly another dimension. It almost adventure. There old black slimy greens salad, least watermelon salad good! I'll give that! The olives even disgusting--how mess olives? The spanokopita limp oily devoid much phyllo. And copious bugs flying around food whole time dined. When paid, cashier asked much tip wanted leave, added directly bill instead giving us opportunity leave tip write restaurant receipt. The bill way high. If really hate someone, take restaurant.
Dirty, unclean, friend I went lunch here. She went go bathroom. Upon returning table following story tell. To get bathroom go kitchen flight stairs. When passing kitchen saw raw chicken left heat congealing it's blood. Christos get second chances stunt like that. The food tasty, come chicken chillen counter go anyone's kitchen.
I crave Jackie O cake, must have!!!!
Christos one worst experiences I've ever dining Pittsburgh. They call Greek restaurant don't even normal gyro menu. My boyfriend I decided split platter, horrible. The gyro meat wasn't spick, dolmades worst thing ever eaten life charged us 4.00 split didn't even ask first place. The pleasant thing place cook ended serving us food waiter went seemed like drug deal. Over all, everything bad I would never return would advice everyone else same.
So....I read reviews Yelp & Urban Spoon. Mostly negative, hey I hungry gave shot. It's true place dingy & like entering Greek grandfather's home. I first asked I wanted huumus. I declined reading mediocre best. So I tried $5.25 saganaki. It came old brown dish looked like rubber floating lemon juice oil. * The owner failed mention pita bread extra. It tasted WORSE looked (if possible). Tough cheese mostly tasteless chewy. * I many saganaki various countries. This ranked one VERY worst! I made best decision leave food poisoning set in. Bottom line: HORRIFIC !!!
So intentions eat Indian place across street however lady ran across street started rattling menu walking. At first I liked moxy, soon realized need bring customers may trouble. Another mistake sitting outside trying bring people in. Our dinner conversation constantly interrupted servers yelling across street side walk potential customers. Now food: I ordered chicken kabob. Very bland actually tasted baked grilled. I didn't finish it. The rice good side veggies weren't bad. The spinach pie ok. They ask "would like hummus snack meal". This free included. I figured I wasn't caught guard. Some people I could see surprised end get bill. My wife got lamb kabob. Bland chewy. It didn't taste fresh, almost frozen one point microwaved. The cheese pie pretty bad. Hummus ok. 2 stars food 3 stars service 1 star experience yelling fishing customers. Seems like may trouble financially could cutting corners stay afloat. I go again. Alihan's next door amazing, I recommend Christo's every day.
WARNING. DO NOT GO HERE. My family visiting sister Pittsburgh eyes set specific restaurant, Christos. A gentleman, I presume owner Christos, saw family I walked street. He flashed us menu, pitching us restaurant best food best. I could barely tell selling food used cars. I kindly told interested. My family, however, indecisive came getting restaurant. We ending wanting go eat restaurant next door Christos backtracked. Again owner flashed us menu, sensing touristy indecision. I declined pointed restaurant I heading to. He ignored pan-handled two sisters, mother wife. They gave dismay. As said "sure..." I looked inside restaurant Christos peak dinner hours. No one inside. Absolutely one. As family walked I rolled eyes, I thought, well let's give chance...my whole family seemed feel bad guy I like Greek food. As got in, seemed nothing going on. We came back kayaking needed wash hands. They didn't seem restroom took sisters mother kitchen downstairs find one. The silence broken finally put music suddenly couple kitchen helpers came looked like warming kitchen equipment up. Were customers tonight? I bet were. Before I could settle in, casually asked I liked pita hummus. Obviously I said yes. He asking casually I didn't even menu, I assumed complimentary said would get some, I waited I found restaurant Yelp phone first review gave one star mentioned owner didn't tell pita extra. Great. The rest family later came back restroom (akin going restroom grocery store you're around stock items...except need go kitchen). They started salad. The waiter asked I wanted anchovies something else salad. I going say "sure" wife stopped said could extra. The waiter, looking like got caught, verified offering extras even though earlier owner said salads came dinner. I say,"I want standard salad, nothing extra." I couldn't let guard down. We ordered food, priced you'd expect. The pita hummus I ordered earlier barely average I don't know thought worth $4. My sister ordered "leg lamb" I expected see leg lamb. Instead plate came out, looked like sad slices ham. Really. We got vegetables soggy unappetizing. I saw earlier kitchen sitting big pot I used restroom. Nothing fresh. My lamb chewy side. My sister's "leg lamb" left uneaten asked I wanted some. I "tried" eat chewy. They asked dessert. I wanted say discontent family members said yes, even telling food great. I don't sense pity. The desert salad best things night, kind sad. When got receipt wife insisted check it. Surprise. They overcharged us $7 two mysterious items. Their receipt doesn't even list ordered. I went cashier ask two items were. He tried explain one really couldn't. He scratched $3 item. I questioned $4 charge. Again tried explain really couldn't. Again agreed scratched $4. On top still gave normal tip pity. I could tell waiters following orders. I could tell owner trained say make extra money. You've warned. There's reason place poorly. There's reason whole hour 7:30pm 8:30pm ones restaurant. There's reason owner begging customer come in. They're cutting corners customer service food quality exchange salesman tactics, overcharging tricking buy things don't even know extra. DO NOT GO HERE. Owners like say,"But I else I won't make it." You know what? Restaurants like shouldn't make it. Not harsh poor experience. Change food, sales tactics fake receipt items strategy. Maybe long time ago started real every dirty trick book nickel dime you. WARNING. DO NOT GO HERE.
This place something STRAIGHT David Lynch film. It felt like I transported sort alternate reality help smiling, overbearing greek man outside restaurant door preying weak indecisive. Something air place comes fundamentally strange, almost, discomforting nightmare-like. You going feel uneasy, I'm trying say. - They overcharged us, probably intentionally. They don't itemized receipts. - The waiter kept giving us options were... free options you're supposed choose. We caught specifically asked cost extra. - The elusive bathroom felt like descending staircase hell. Better nothing, I suppose. - The food.... oh god. None food good. In fact outright gross/uneatable. The hummus decent, but... I also get decent hummus Trader Joe's. We initially felt bad guys. A struggling business always sad see. But strange behavior, attempts scam us, etc. sympathy turned sense understanding place isn't well. If owners reading this-- I'm sorry review came harsh.. really, please, rethink way going business. I don't want fail, I want overcome this. Do right way, scummy way. I know you're trying, try differently.
Ordered take Christos. I ordered diet coke cup. THANK GOODNESS I took lid first. There HUNDREDS large white particles diet coke looked like paint chips, eggshells paper dissolve liquid remained floating around. This health hazard needless say, I ordering establishment again. As food, mediocre best The baklava average, mixed grille kabab (chicken lamb) okay, dry chewy times overall edible. The salad came mixed grille decent flavor brown old lettuce it. As cold combination, tzatziki, one grape leaf, hummus fine tarmasalata ingredient clearly spoiled. The crème caramel (greek version flan) floating water, really strange texture; guess frozen defrosted, dessert absolutely floating large pool water.
The food Christos solid. I would order again, although hummus rather small portion $4.
If like rotting salad, rude staff, greasy food, stupid stories Jackie Onassis favorite dessert place you. Absolutely terrible. I cannot say single good thing place, it's tough figure remain business.
I've tried twice ever mention you're going Pittsburgh first thing hear "Oh Man, HAVE go Primanti's". Sorry, I guess it's thing. It's horrible I take french fries pile up, it's definitely thing.
If isn't true yinzer sandwich, I'm sure is. Two slices thick, soft Italian bread, choice meat cheese, heaping portion coleslaw, fistful French fries layered right in. Come hungry!
Average. I'm big whole cole slaw-french fry sandwich thing ok. Primanti's also good wings. Also, salad isnt bad. I often get cheese fries go lunch. You get decent amount $3.50 (for downtown standards). The sucky thing fries normally cold.. warm, cold. -_- make pouring scalding hot cheese sauce mask cold fries. Well played friend. doesnt stop coming every 2 months
Primanti Bros. list places stop awhile now. Being fan famous RUHUNGRY grease trucks New Brunswick, NJ place owed explanation. And boy oh boy respond. I ordered two sandwiches I could taste one I ended eating entire Jumbo Baloney Cheese well Cajun Chicken. The bread big player sandwiches. Soft firm enough hold together meat, cheese, slaw, fries, tomato, onions (optional worth it). If I choice RUHUNGRY fat sandwich one these, yikes! Sorry RUHUNGRY The Primanti Bros. win battle! What's wrong it? As overstuffed sandwich fall victim avalanche. I don't suggest wear tuxedo bring first date. A bib recommended! When I return PA, know I'll back, jack!
Place sucks. Loser rude servers ignore even stand register wait- get ignored. This place going down. Server said"you don't matter - I million people take care of" This waiting 20+ minutes register cash hand. I understand it's busy- acknowledge people - appreciate customers! When tell us F off- ar going DOWN! Rude! Not worth it.
Very bad foods. No flavor, dried under-seasoned. Very bad service. They rude. They open sandwich, break half, look know start calling name sandwich table. I recommend place. I gone subway.
Full disclosure: bigger party place usually handles. So cards stacked them. That said, place NOT good. Firstly, food flavor. That nothing party size. I ordered sardine & cheese, party grilled chicken sandwiches, black bean burgers, & cheese steaks ordered. The sandwiches big, especially price. But flavoring, overcooked, unseasoned meat many steak fries (in sandwich) & weak cheese. The seasoning available salt, pepper, hot sauce, & ketchup. BIG disappointment. I'll cut slack service big party, couldn't handle well. Their stress evident, & took away service. If one person, would 1 star. But second start pity party size
First time Pittsburgh I fairly disappointed "coleslaw fries sandwich" bonanza. It may expectations sky high due hype Food Network reviews friend raving must-have town. The service quick, atmosphere casual cool. We ordered burger (which I would probably decide I ever go back, try another) fried pickles, also alright (nothing amazing). They serve sandwich piece paper (parchment paper?) instead baskets dishes, little disappointing considering city seems quite sustainability initiatives (more Honolulu--yay Pittsburgh). It also seemed change perspective sandwich tad... Overall, party mixed reviews meals. If I ever make back Burgh, I would give another shot. Maybe different sandwich beer next time around wash down.
The thing place going local hype. The sandwiches lack flavor, it's another one places try say did.
I recommended place I told friends I visiting Pittsburgh. I ordered "Pitts-burger" sandwich dry, seasoned, disappointing say least. The meat seemed like previously frozen reminded Salisbury steak you'd served lunch cafeteria. The fries unsalted required lots ketchup. The coleslaw lacked flavor bun simple white bread. I know lot hype surrounding place I would recommend heading elsewhere.
Many Pittsburgh locals suggested I give place shot I took business trip here. If place considered good locals, I feel sorry people Pittsburgh. I ordered Pittsburgher cheese steak Kolbassi & cheese. For sandwiches, bread used extremely bland borderline stale. The bread would crumble attempted bite, eventually leading abandoning them. The fries dry stale tasting well I thought better throw out. The veggies average, fresh, didn't taste gross. All left cheese meats. They may disappointing I thought I could maybe least enjoy that. Essentially, entire sandwich inedible I settled Five Guys instead.
The sandwiches seem like neat idea they're stuffed Fries coleslaw. But that's taste eat sandwiches. In reality there's little meat, lots bread, lots fries, result sandwiches dry flavorless. Add lots ketchup help chewing process.
We expecting much more. We course wanted see hype about. We ordered "Pitt burger" boy disappointing. The burger dry lacks flavor. The fries old greasy. The Cole slaw ok, help taste buds experience little flavor. The bread worst part. Big, dry, old. Ugh. They fried pickles didn't get chance try those. Trust reviews, it's worth wait money!
Saw place featured travel channel looking forwarded trying it. Got place limited customers busy, service poor variety items. I pastrami &cheese sandwich good, overall place overrated, disappointed, considering reviews travel channel.....Never coming back
A juicy burger slaw, fries, fried egg. I don't order way anywhere else, I care so. Other places simply cannot execute meal skill confidence Primanti Bros.
What? This place insane today! Slinging food like nobody's business! So fun watch busy today! Only regret sharing sandwich dining partner getting small half! Deliciously decadent, obscene.
I love Primanti's sandwiches. I'm Pittsburgher always love sandwiches. If want hear those, read reviews. This one service restaurant. It's bad. The servers polite, extremely inattentive. I'm going go ahead play "I Waited Tables High Volume Restaurants Several Years" card I say even lunch rush, no, level absence acceptable. They take fifteen minutes even greet table, leaves looking around wondering serving you, least water. If I serving, I'd least pop say quick, "Hi, name's Ali. I'll minutes." No matter busy are, things don't let slip: greetings, drink refills, speedy check. If it's busy, communicate delay saying "thank waiting," "sorry wait." Honestly that's takes. That's it! Primanti's servers lacking things, customer perspective, really make difference experience. Ok, sorry rant, either need better train servers have, hire aren't stretched thin.
Came another couple here. We ordered time. We sat counter. They got food 5-10 minutes. We got 25 minutes later. We saw orders dine take come order - went still waited ours. Sitting counter, saw thought order grill frying long time. We asked skinny guy glasses waiter happened sandwiches- hand gestures towards grill mumbles something walking quickly away. We finally get food couple almost finished. Sure enough food sitting grill - cooked burned. I sent back - showed gal burned pastrami sandwich. Her response black burn pastrami. She attitude reluctantly made new one 5 minutes. The ice tea tasted old wait got bill get refill. In watching operation counter interested singing words piped music serving customers. This staff needs serious lessons public relations social skills. For part rude inattentive. The food ok. I felt bad couple brought us - apologized several times service bad experience. People make break business- bad employees tarnish businesses reputation- I recommend place - sorry. One star - star, tip, coming back Ever!
I enjoyed going location close downtown. If like watch people, try getting patio table. You wont disappointed. I also like sit bar I get chance see sammich made! I like systems!
Spent night Pittsburgh way NY Norton, Ohio. Heard sandwiches, needed give go here. We spent weekend Philly December, thought maybe rival sandwich cheesesteak. It not. We split Pitts-burger, dry, even recommended hot sauce. It tasted like meat-loaf burger, even cole-slaw fries actual sandwich could salvage - imagine bad must even can't help. We order Buffalo wings well, would included conversation worst wings we've ever had. The tater-tots great, definitely stay menu. The service beer selection fine, especially service. Glasses never empty long, would even ask fill right done. Super helpful questions may had. We immediately seated, even though swamped working asses off. So stars service beer, sandwich something I would again, unlike Philly cheesesteaks.
Disgusting. Truly one least favorite places visit neighborhood. Guests always mention can't wait try go here. I dread point. Id prefer never go back location. The staff friendly. The bar isn't terrible, food is. You would think since chain food would same. Wrong. Somehow location serves poorly executed examples menu items. Save hassle. Go Primanti's besides one.
Food ok. Not seasoned, fries soggy people behind counter friendly
Not worth even one-time visit. "Hey, it's first time Pittsburgh, travel websites say check Primanti Bros!" That's I said myself, least. Spoiler alert: sucks. For one, service terrible. My server straight forgot order, instead asking again, ignored 20 minutes. And I sitting right grill, walked 30 times. I figured things backed since busy, I finally spoke I overheard cook whispering didn't know I ordered. The food sucks. Their "signature sandwich" plain white bread, tiny serving unseasoned "sirloin," single slice flavorless "provolone", big stack unseasoned French fries sandwich, blandest "cole slaw" I ever had, another slice plain white bread. You leave smelling like cooking oil. And beer selection sucks. They one local beer, it's Iron City, get anywhere. This place surrounded restaurants, I wish I gone literally single one them.
I excited visit stay Pittsburgh 4 different people recommended me, I called place to-go order I hung 3 times!! Horrible customer service! Y'all getting ANY business/ recommendations me!
Primanti's Pittsburgh classic, I've always felt sort obligation love place. Although I certainly appreciate uniqueness Primanti's sandwich, I don't understand hype. So I again, hoping time I finally become Primanti's fanatic. The restaurant busy came lunch Saturday afternoon. There bit wait, employees efficient came getting us seated quickly possible. Our waitress, however, seemed preoccupied customers, spent lot time waiting get attention. Frustrating, is. They offer two vegetarian sandwich options: Deluxe Double Egg & Cheese Southwest Black Bean Burger. Both good, I've always preferred black bean burger, I decided give egg & cheese another shot. It average quality sandwich. Nothing mind-blowing. Though I usually love pile fries, fries undercooked point insides RAW. Once again, Primanti's, failed impress me. Purely it's Primanti's, I probably back. If sandwich shop, thanks.
For hype disappointing. Just bunch random flavors (Bologna, coleslaw, friend fries) seemed cancel out. You needed supplied hot sauce give flavor. Skip it.
I visiting California disappointed service food. It bread coleslaw. The waiter nice all! Blah!!!!
My office often gets Pizza delivered Monte Cello's. The crust thin pizza decent. I gone times lunch grab slices pizza (with others). I agree small fountain drinks refills annoying. If I going eat in, I prefer Villa Reale Smithfield. You get slices lunch sit counter.
Monte Cellos located fairly close work, I've gone times. Each time, I ask myself, "Why I going back?" Mediocre dish Mediocre dish, somehow I think get better next time. Last time I Grilled Chicken Salad they're known --- least that's cashier said. It grilled chicken, french fries, little cheese chopped lettuce. Can say B-O-R-I-N-G? Today I steak hoagie. Enough places Pittsburgh comparing easy. While bread fresh, hoagie buns huge --- it's downhill here. Enter three slices steak-ums contents hoagie flat. The bread 90% meal. Unmemorable. I happy pizza I there, salads hoagies? Not much.
This alltime worst McDonalds I life. When first enter breach wall scumbags asking change cigarettes sidewalk. Upon entering immediately greeted pure chaos. Children screaming, bums asking change, people losing minds. The service horrible...friendly horrible. I ordered two double cheeseburgers waited twenty minutes them. I opened sandwiches appeared made dog...or someone lacks fingers. This McDonalds straight crap. I'd rather eat cigarette butts ever eat again.
Their tacos alright groceries kind expensive. I've never seen Goya brand beans priced $1.50. I mean seems like little thing, couldn't $.89 San Francisco, everything else totally unaffordable.
I think like 1.5 stars. I got 6-pack tamales. They expensive I would've guessed (I sort to, considering weren't priced). First I open package low-and-behold bag six tamales, fact, contains five! The filling fine, masa blows. It dry gritty. The preparation instructions seem questionable (microwave plastic bag? Really?). I'm saving remaining ones I'm drunk care anything. The tortillas still worth it.
Just moved Pittsburgh San Diego I shocked find serve Carne Asada here. This shop life saver I want authentic mexican food.
Being LA, I disappointed tacos. The Carne Asada bland didn't think authentic Mexican food another street faire.
Try fish shrimp tacos. They amazing! Don't bother one chicken. I thought quite bland!

I think 'Burghers gooping pants Reyna's tacos they've never anything Taco Bell cousin Mad Mex. I'm southwestern part country I certainly appreciate freshness "clarity" food served outside Reyna's, I impressed it. It nothing I couldn't don't already make home. Since Pittsburgh never southwestern states whatnot, I guess I could go along saying best tacos city.
I crave tacos sun shining!
This review taco stand front Reyna's, run owner Reyna's Casa Reyna. Note *not* stand one around corner 21st Street, across alley Pamela's. I got order three tacos cold day couple weekends ago. The meat cold I could start eating it, I assumed cooled quickly. Within hours everything I eaten leaving hurry. I felt sick weak rest day, better (and completely empty) next morning. Never going back, course. This doesn't directly reflect Casa Reyna's inside restaurant, since people run it, makes worry food handling standards. I'll probably keep getting Reyna's big bag chips I need party, I'm never eating prepared food again.
I moved Pittsburgh New Mexico excited hear place. Unfortunately, good I hoped. The cashier argued boyfriend kind dried red chiles buy, harassed browsing store (she yelled across store: "Are done yet? I already started ringing up."). The house-made corn tortillas bland help guy running nearby taco stand (who work Reyna's) find right chiles... The cashier idea asking for. Then Hatch green chile fiasco. Shortly arriving here, I searching Hatch green chile area found Reyna's would pre-orders. Hooray! I ordered paid online. The website said would roasting store I called ask it. I told rude manner roasting would happen pepper festival, I would pay $7 per person attend, get chile get roasted. Okay, fine. The day festival I called store confirm actual pre-order would available festival. I mid-question clerk phone interrupted me: "What? ... Can call back later, I'm really busy." WTF? So I go festival get chile. The people roasting station seem confused I present pre-order receipt, eventually figure out, telling come back later get isn't roasted yet. We walked around festival hour went back, even confusion whether ready. Finally figure give us roasted chile. Hooray! Oh wait though. We get home open and... Apparently don't know roast correctly. We bought bulk roasted chiles New Mexico every year never issues peeling freezing it. This chile roasted? It's somehow completely mushy falling apart, almost visible char, it's fucking impossible remove peel. It's horrible. So tl;dr - rude employees, person phone. Little product knowledge. And absolutely knowledge roast green chiles, despite whole event around chiles. I won't going back.
The chicken fajitas enough two served pineapple. My friend's margarita poured 3 glasses looked tasty. Think I would come back again, probably try places strip district first.
Warning: If put one tacos head, tongue WILL burrow brain get it. Not closed either.
This fourth try. We went basement resturant another disappointing exsperiance. The chubby female bartender side shaves head rude. Even though table waitress. The bartender visited table three times rush us drinks get check. She charged us badly made drinks. The staff, always friendly helpful. The food drinks priced is. We returning trip. We kept feeling like give Reynas resturant another chance, one last.
I went Saturday afternoon wanted sit front. The host made fun me! Said "aw, that's bad" I said me. No, perfectly fine book! I got lobster roll, plenty lobster garlic bread roll. It ok. The annoying part host kept coming talk me. I really wanted chill myself, get hit creepy host!
OMG nightmare. I last saturday 9pm group 10 people second floor bar area. The bartenders acted like big inconvience there. ordered drinks didnt even get thank you. bar dirty littered dirty glasses. The restrooms filthy didnt even toliet paper . We left bar spent HUGE anoun money street.. I never go back.
Another place I visit every years thinking couldn't bad I remember it. And place NEVER lets down; it's bad I remember. The seafood breaded fried point inedible. The staff rude. The prices high quality. Just around disappointing.
Went place lunch last Saturday, party five. The service extremely slow every beer tried order, got response "We one". Finally got sandwiches (after long wait) coleslaw fries soggy stale. When asked waitress coleslaw (which supposed side every sandwich), response "I think out, let check". And waitress didn't return done eating. Forget getting refill drink water..
We went seafood frenzy here! Ordered appetizers. Beer steamed shrimp, raw oysters & clams, regular steamed shrimp, Maryland seafood soup...we ate could eat anymore. Portions well sized price reasonable.
NEVER AGAIN!!!! Horrible service horrible food! It took 20 minutes waitress even come table! Looking back it, I don't know didn't leave... maybe wait 20 minutes even get table (this summer). We ordered muscles start okay definitely something I would recommend. My husband ordered fish chips I ordered crab cakes.... EPIC FAIL!!! The crab cakes disgusting husband I switch meals. The crab cakes taste like fried mayo... I couldn't even taste crab! The fish chips looked great didn't taste like anything! No seasoning all! The waitress bad came time give us check, found. It took 15 minutes actually get check (keep mind already finished eating)... thank God cash! A complete waste $40. Yes, I remember exactly much I spent even though months ago I kept thinking I could spent money better place! I could got mani & pedi... great sushi... list goes on. lol
If you're mediocre over-priced sports bars average food, slow service cackling hyenas, place you, hands-down.
My husband I went tonight dinner. Bad mistake. Worst meal we've ever had. The salad actually tasted like moth ball it. The sword fish ordered seemed like piece fatty beef could cut knife! The fried calamary absolutely terrible, someone took handfull dough fried clumbs hid meat it! The best part I got refund soup I didn't even recieve! I don't recommend unless drinking don't care food taste. Busy, slow awful.
I immediately displeased snaggle toothed hostess surly demeanor. The air conditioning non existent, hangover nightmare. While waiting table bartender ignored us ten minutes couldn't even transfer drinks table. He also casually instructed one must pay per beer - duh! I'm beer drinking novice. The acne-ridden server friendly enough, seemed forlorn overtly sweating. Bringing drinks table isn't neuroscience I don't drink tap water. After sitting table minutes apparent entire serving staff haggard. Appetizer - crab artichoke dip. Bland. Where's crab? Also, toddler arrange plate? Apparently. Meal - fish tacos. Came quickly surprisingly flavorful. However, server never checked status beckon fulfill needs. I shouldn't ask napkins point need. No tip, never coming back.
We went dinner Sunday night. It quite loud, evening Steeler's game, hadnt anticipated loud crowd 5pm. Then again, Pittsburgh, it's given. The waitress slow getting around us. We felt like inconvenience rather patron. The kids ordered pizza said awesome. I ordered lobster roll maybe expectations high given reviews, I disappointed. My husband ordered swordfish unimpressed. I won't back.
We frustrating disappointing experience Roland's, dining experience recent 4-day visit Pittsburgh. First, food extremely overpriced. The quality would find ordering bar...but twice expensive. The $16 I paid fried cod got two soggy cod filets, steamed bland vegetables boring roasted potatoes. I couldn't tried make food poor. It Sysco food operation gone wrong: runoff Houlihan's mixed Joe's Crab Shack. The service slow cancelling orders due delay bringing table. My dish arrived without sort sauce, even get order beer bar waitress behind. It "second day job," unacceptable. They could least comp'd beers, offered way make (besides coming informing us charged beers bill). Roland's space available Monday night, unlike restaurants neighborhood. This really convenient initially, I idea case.
I would give restaurant 0 stars I could. The food lousy, drinks expensive, service awful. I complained manager experience told I didn't like it, plenty bars The Strip District. Please, please, please go somewhere else.
Well I several meals years Rolands, many good. Yesterday one days. After seated, took nearly 10 minutes server greet us take drink order. I course rewarded wrong beer. Then order food arrived, fries cold fish sandwich rather greasy. I wake today 'sick' whole ordeal. My mother, food I did, feeling me. Get act together Rolands, better this.
Just awful. My companions ordered Alfredo pasta honestly thought (through entire meal) Roland's served mashed potatoes pasta. We thought "maybe it's 'burgh thing." Nope, informed end meal waiter indeed Alfredo sauce chef "just liked use lot parmesan cheese Alfredo." This stuff consistently cold oatmeal oil poured (no exaggeration) bucket full plate. Anybody would serve plates business whatsoever kitchen. By way, lobster roll buttery, greasy fail well. What complete disaster.
If I could give lesser star I would. This place terrible. The seafood tasted old. It super chewy tasteless. The service slow waitress spilled fish broth one members party. The bathrooms gross probably never clean. I hoping I don't get food poisoning later tonight.
Tasteless food. Too slow service. Was waiting check 15 minutes. Dishes ex-USSR buffet taste. Annoying waiter.
This place something. By that, I mean interesting. We fished restaurant one employees. That's thing Christos, employees stand outside menu pressuring people come in. I'm sure working hard desperate. It could Christos one many Mediterranean restaurants 6th Ave need stand somehow. My husband I decided give chance food decent: flavorful, comforting decently priced. He got Chicken Kebab I got Souzoukakia Spanakopita Combo. The decor seemed little outdated I'm ok that, gives place charm. However, attitude employees towards turned place. Our waitress kept saying Christo, owner, rude happy got server. And two seemed fight customer walked in. Whether like not, really shouldn't evident customers.
1) The owner pushy. He asks questions like, "Do want salad fries order?" Then choose one charges it! It's NOT side dish...it's EXTRA! 2) The portions SMALL! 3) The lemonade 80% ice! 4) The bill cost much higher ordered explanation got high. 5) $5 tip even though owner server. 6) The cook owner eat waiting customers. 7) The rice small portion borderline disgusting, hummus. 8) The server (also owner) touches food serves it! His thumb pressing pita bread! Anyone thinks restaurants like eaten restaurant before! I really hope NOT authentic Greek food tastes NOT Greeks business!
Fettucini can, anyone? If like paying $10 tasteless pasta sauces, place! Stay away never look back.
Service lacking food mediocre. When I crave Italian first place I think of.
Disappointed. That one word sums group 15's experience Spaghetti Warehouse. This restaurant Pittsburgh institution long; however, left many group unsatisfied hungry end. My mom ordered roasted garlic shrimp dish dry shrimp cooked point chewy. I ordered chopped salad "warehouse style" main entree big salad. Yet veggies salad weren't fresh warm chicken burnt wilted lettuce heat. I sent back without eating (at least waitress kind enough take bill). My fiance got lasagna chicken parm classic combo section menu chicken ok great. The lasagna good too. However, neither great. My aunt father unimpressed dishes well I'm sure got I can't speak food quality. Also, took us hour ordered receive food food cold. Granted, I understand party 15 BUT restaurant packed stretch means. In fact room sat approximately 10 open tables. I can't speak filled rooms restaurant though. But hour wait gotten cold food result it. We booked restaurant rehearsal dinner wedding but, considering poor food incredibly slow service (no fault waitress), looking change reservations different restaurant. We chose Spaghetti Warehouse close hotel guests wedding staying. Given slow service was, can't afford til 10:30pm night 6am next morning long day. (Another reviewer said rehearsal dinner group took 3+ hours get there). Just 2 cents. I wish food quality service better. I'm glad found rehearsal dinner.
Why come place tasty world Italian restaurants right hungry fingers town! The place essentially tourist-trap seeks reel folks looking "fun" looking italian warehouse (now...how would fun? Apparently some.) Don't get wrong...the food atrocious. But certainly sub-par. My chicken parm quite un-tasty seemed spaghetti come can. The service mediocre. Keep driving Bloomfield!
We coming since opened, go back three last visits. It gone downhill badly. Three visits ago seated trolley completely ignored 30 minutes. There waitress, apparently new front half. I finally went front demanded manager finally assigned waitress us comp'ed meals. The lasagna disappointing hard noodles definitely oven baked barely warm. Two visits ago use gift cards intended use previous visit, service poor food fair. The last visit last night third strike SW OUT! Very poor service food. The drinks ice refills timely. The server past table many times, flew time like there. The zucchini appetizer good. We got one loaf bread barely done came almost butter. No ranch dressing...really! This Strip District many stores crying loud. The food poor. The spaghetti meatballs tablespoon sauce. The fetticini alfredo almost devoid sauce, well. My Wild Mushroom Chicken warm tasted okay. We NOT going back. Olive Garden Bravos North Hills getting business on.
Didn't think possible, it's worse Olive Garden...food horrible extremely overpriced, service decidedly lacking.... Neat location fun interesting decor I wouldn't eat again.
Why anyone would willing go eat beyond me. I read prior yelp reviews I knew I getting into. To make long story short, I went I several people wanted go I really choice. Anyway, I ordered wild mushroom pasta chicken. The sauce really disgusting. I found eating pieces chicken breast. I brought meal home husband isn't picky I am, took two bites got mad warning aweful meal was. I eating group people choose go again.
Not much say Steelers sports world doesn't already know. The Steelers model Professional Football teams strive be. From ownership, players, stadium, fan base all. The ONLY downfall Steeler fan trying get tickets difficult trying catch cheetah open prairie. For want experience like bad can't land tickets game I would recommend going 2-3 hours game join tailgating festivities. Once game starts take friends one many northside bars enjoy game. McFaddens Bettis's tops list.
Spaghettie warehouse server Will spilled meal floor spilled coat. The manager Megan came made feel like fault, offered take drink meal bill, send bill dry cleaning coat. She said sorry walking away! Never coming back again.
The food horrible - serve pasta marinara sauce even toss pasta sauce? I truly received pile watery noodles ladle sauce top. Actually, name says all. While place italian food menu, isn't italian bone body. You feel served italian food irish line cook. The restaurant decor really nice last decorated 1981, also last time updated menu.
There better Italian food Pittsburgh -- I don't know anyone would come here. I overnight field trip students Pittsburgh & tour company took us murder mystery dinner show. They us sectioned great privacy & also since students loud. Their service hot mess!!!! They 2 waiters serving 50 person group & organized all. Just getting drinks confusing. The waiters came drink & asked -- anyone order this?? This table sat drinkless, breadless, & saladless longest time. For dinner, given salad, entree, & tiramisu. The salad definitely straight bag & doused cheap dressing. It didn't taste fresh all. There list 8 entrees could choose from. They came quite haphazardly. I unfortunately ordered fettuccine alfredo -- worst ever. I could make better alfredo using sauce supermarket jar. I tried douse pepper & cheese alas nothing help it. Some others said chicken parm alright said undercooked. The tiramisu also gross. It definitely made & cut awhile ago & kept cold fridge. The redeeming parts dinner decor & old fashioned coin operated games AND mystery show. I've never one & really excited. They started ate entrees & intermissioned dessert. The actors super funny & interactive -- students loved course makes happy. Seriously though, food bad.
We went recently right 2-day, 150-mile bike ride carbo-load. The food okay - probably expected low prices - service horrible. It busy, could get waitresses attention despite multiple attempts. We needed refill asked one took dinner order, reminded dinner arrived. We finally able flag 10 minutes later remind again. It also took 20 minutes get check FINISHED entrees. I sure servers bad, I'm sure I back find out.
Under wire season except expected 1-3 Ben benched 4 games.
Decent, great
She's dressed black yellow, says "Hello, come sit next fine fellow." You run without second lose And comes next, Steelers bust move!!!
Came later evening weekday empty building. No host/ess, wandering servers, customers... We search place someone seat us first people ran couple off-duty servers rolling silverware. The male kindly sat us got drinks us. It took ridiculously long time server even appear table long food come out. To make everything worse, couple restaurant sitting behind us complaining server food. The server returned table bit later (no manager) said "the manager" told since food made early day, lose texture flavor time served. WHAT? Seriously???? It hard enjoy food time arrived. The food left much desired. The service worst I've ever encountered. I don't usually leave complaints restaurant websites I leave one terrible visit. They gave us coupon free appetizer. Needless say return redeem it.
Whatever happened place? Seriously. I remember couldn't even get door. Now I walk feel like walking right back out. Overall, I've got complaints food. I think it's average priced well. The lasagna top notch. And private lot Strip District nice. I usually dine last two trips I placing order go. After first time I learned lesson called ahead. Never again. The first time, I walked went bar area (as directed sign hostess station, actual person) place go order. But one there. It's funny, waiters walk bar area even use bar get drinks. But seems don't like actually wait customers even make eye contact. After waiting way long even acknowledged, order taken. The waiter ended helping me, Andrae, apologized least nice. I asked two salads happy accomodate. But I waited again. I'm sure food took long, Andrae knew I waiting threw extra bread. Despite wait, least I felt like I Andrae took interest making sure I taken care apology sincere. Skip second time. While I bad memories last visit, I hoping isolated incident gave Spaghetti Warehouse benefit doubt. Except....things worst. I start wonder ever actual bartender. But I'm sitting bar, waiting achknowledgement employee, one two managers conducting interviews bar area. While happening, several waitresses come bar get drinks. Not one even looks direction, let alone ask I need something. I didn't want rude interrupt interviews conducted, good ten minutes waiting, I went hostess stand entrance. I waited minute two one waitresses previously ignored came out. I little salty her, I'll admit. I explained I waiting bar sign says one take order. She said could take order again, I directed wait bar. Back bar, interviews over, I spoke one managers I ignored. She apologized said thought someone waited me. She offered take order I told unnecessary I placed waitress hostess stand. A minutes later, manager came tell deducted $10 bill apologized again. I wasn't expecting that, least admission poor customer service. However I received to-go bag, I found one salad one loaf bread. I guess I'm trying say is....beware placing to-go orders. It's probably best call ahead. The service hit miss daily basis, definitely beyond miss trying get food go.
There experience like watching The Pittsburgh Steelers crucial game home. The stadium electric. Steelers fans insanely passionate team, bordering unhealthy obsession. Good luck trying get ticket face value.
Benchmark professional football. Most superbowls sport. Have biggest fan following teams. Picked steam dynasty years 1970s. Before then, Steelers terrible team. Right draft picks, right coaching staff changes everything. Today one feared teams NFL. Their play represents city. Tough, blue collared north east resident appreciate. Grade: A
The lasagna good everything else average. Overall, I didn't like atmosphere. We went Saturday night people 10 o'clock table left.
My friend lives near I came satisfy deli sandwich craving. The inside super dingy deli/convenience store, I excited real, dirty deli sandwich. They lot weird items grocery section kind fun look through. I got Italian "hoagie" I feel appropriate term ultra-Pittsburgh spot. It bad. Totally skimpy meat, American cheese mayo, don't go well Italian meats all...provolone oil & vinegar would made way sense. The bread squishy white bun. I mean, I still ate it, I didn't really enjoy it. It made kind sad. It sad, floppy excuse sandwich. At least cheap? Maybe I gotten chipped ham instead, since that's famous for. I also suspect location North Hills least marginally better...this Isaly's clearly past prime.
It's cathartic give sorry organization 1 star. Note: review baseball club, stadium play
You can't screw pasta--it would hard. Only Buca di Beppo managed that, drowning pasta salt charging nose it. The food pretty darn good. I love bread bring table atmosphere fun. My problem past four times I've here, service awful. Tonight waiter brought bread salads drinks huge problem bc I dying thirst. Our waiter (Vincent) 3 tables. It like trained bring table anything unless hte two tables needed something. He would disappear 20 minutes time (I'm kidding). I gave drink order asked dinner order. He came entrees one table, salads other, bread table. Why would get drinks? You come back table multiple times!!! This happened past four times I dined here, I'm awful service. Too bad I won't back, bc I wanted love restaurant. Good food, AWFUL service. 2 stars bc I love carbs damn much.
We're .500 far year! Whoo-hoo! We're actually mediocre! And Cubs keeping us last place instead way around!
A cautious 3.5 stars but.... S-W-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-P! The Bucs swept Royals interleague play past weekend! And okay, I second game, third. But I took dad game early Father's Day gift. We wonderful time Pirates defeated Royals 5-3. And I'm watching Pirates guarded optimism here. They're great start last year. An article paper said playing small ball, must eman they're working little things, fundamentals. Now let's see keep momentum going rest season finish least winning record chiange. Oh well, least Chicago Cubs sucking badly won't cellar.
Beware purchasing partial season packages. I bought 2014 13 game package lied post season ticket purchase opportunities. In order purchase tickets 2014 post season games I told I upgrade purchase full 2015 season package else buy online like general public. Also exchange policy unused tickets requires snail mail physical trip stadium office. However future ticket exchange done online 48 hours prior game. They cater new business full season ticket holders post season ticket sales, existing partial season holders get priority whatsoever.
Arrived 7:15 Saturday night, 20 minute wait although although empty tables visible. Got seated 7:30, put order shortly thereafter. We got bread soups fairly quickly sat hour without signs food. We looked around restraint obvious tables waiting we're getting frustrated. The waitress apologized kitchen slow, gave another 15 minutes finally walked 9:15 still hungry. The food I saw looked good, I would never recommend place. It doesn't take hour half make friggin salad pasta.
I went seeing musical terrible. My sister I ordered Seafood Mediterraneo, supposed clams shrimp creamy sauce. There one shrimp mine sauce wasdefinitely I call creamy. My sister sent back cold. I starved tried mine still little warm. The place old outdated, restrooms horrible. Save money make spaghetti home! Not nice place delicious food I remember 15-20 years ago.
Came year ago meet friends... overall good experience. There 4 us I don't think one plate cleared drinks refilled, slow weeknight well. So yes could bad luck waitress, food sub-par atmosphere well. I suppose good dining option situations, many places area, I guess nothing write home me.
DO NOT GO HERE! They understaffed, incompetent, slow. It like getting waited 1st job people. The place smells like bleach. It's tacky hot. They play pop music it's supposed Italian place. Not one person ever smiled I treated like body chair person wanting enjoy meal. Very slow service authenticity meals. I suggest eating seafood dumpster plan going here.
Im soo surprised food ate. Im California excited experience restaurant. Especially, since local fav. I ordered house made spaghetti expecting fresh tomato base sauce. Unfortunately I got tasted like canned sauce minced onions. It no...flavor! Now maybe I ruined meal ordering gluten free noodles....but I didnt think would make bad. Im soo sorry server awesome even accommodated big party. On good note, bread delicious. As much I hate Olive Garden...I would preferred that.
A long long time ago far away place, I used go place called Spaghetti Warehouse cool, clean, good service, really good food. But place gone I'm left place dirty, horrible service, mediocre food. The end. Never coming back.
Took two half hours get food. All food thrown together pan. Not worth $55.
Ordered delivery. The food showed 2.5 hours later-which acceptable, it's (just) within delivery window specified. However, food apparently prepared within 15 minutes receiving order, cold time got it. I didn't listen reviews paid price (literally)... someone else saved crappy SW dinner review, meal (or lack thereof) vain.
Worst place ever. I took friend first time son. We waited hour food. The waiter got us water sangria 30 min later salads another 40 min kid begging pizza decided go. The reason messed order. We talked manager I'm assuming didn't really care. Said hopefully come back service isn't usually bad. Never again. Unprofessional rude
Our terrible experience began 45 minute wait find half tables empty table behind us consoled manager bad experience. We hopped one typical. Our waiter prompt aloof, days. The food mostly bland flavorless point could finish it. This things took turn worse, order boxed fell floor. Despite insistence want another overcompensating manager brought anyway. We passed party behind us, maybe took home added seasoning, needs it. Avoid place costs!
We went Saturday night. We told would 30 minute wait...but likely closer 45-50 minutes. The food average. Nothing special. Didn't seem handmade anything like that. I thought known lasagna...so I got that. Blah...average. Service incredibly slow. I don't think waiter checked us once. I probably wouldn't go back. Visited October 2014
We went sixteen people. The good thing visit dinner bunch friends. The service pretty good considering large party. My wife I got Sicilian Sampler Appetizer The Ultimate Feast two, dinner entree. The Calamari uneatable Ravioli right nasty. The wedding soup worst I ever had. The meat balls absolute taste, kind like cardboard. The Pork Sausage tasted burnt. The Spaghetti tasted different Boxed pasta. The Lasagna might 15 layers 12 noodles sauce, search meat cheese. Our garlic bread came literally black. I can't even believe somebody would serve that. We back.
I stopped family day Thanksgiving. My sister, niece, parents Children's Museum struck fit nostalgia--my mom used take us kids. Either whole operation gone severely downhill, I young notice bad is. Between us, ordered chicken Alfredo, lasagna, cheese ravioli. Every dish several things wrong it. The chicken likely cooked week dirty cafeteria shipped Strip District. It dry looked reconstituted. The ravioli lukewarm best, sister said lasagna tasted microwaved. Even bread stale. Our waitress also forgetful bit cold. I didn't get salad I ordered, dishes stayed table fifteen twenty minutes empty, water refills inconsistent. As former server myself, I'd like think I know one's control one's control. This woman simply snuff. With Lidia's right Smallman Street, I idea Warehouse staying business. Spend extra dollars go there. It'll worth it.
I difficult time determining worse Spaghetti Warehouse Olive Garden. Mushy spaghetti drenched worst sauce I ever had. Ok second thought Olive Garden better.
I wish possible give place 0 stars. I ate twice, hated food times, felt like I bizzaro funhouse instead restaurant. They clearly thing go ridiculous decor imagine distract lousy food. They're wrong.
The pasta consistently overcooked. The service poor, staff rude. I visit restaurant again. I'm Italian, I cook way better myself.
Went purchasing Groupon. There little bit wait expected Saturday night. We seat table like requested. We waited 15 minutes waitress came over. She took drink food order time. I ordered broccoli mushrooms added piece salmon. My husband ordered Trio. Our waitress. Abby, disappeared waited long time refills. When food arrived, salmon $5 burnt, I could eat half it. My husband said Alfredo tasted like stuff you'd get box. Needless say, didn't Groupon, we'd never go. And we'll never back.
We waited 10 minutes, seemingly reason, plenty tables open. While waiting, I used restroom, smelled like old mop numerous broken doors unsanitary looking fixtures. As far meal, bread garlic butter good that's decent part meal. Our salads drenched dressing covered tasted like average, store-bought croutons. After placing order, waited nearly hour food, ask twice. My son's macaroni cheese salty cold. It tasted like under-cooked noodles alfredo sauce - something kids would like. My mom's food came cold congealed. The dishes, hot, slightly better pasta I could've made home. I say server, manager, polite friendly; however, based sub-par experience awful food, I won't returning.
Stuffed mushrooms good. Baked ziti average. Salad boring iceburg one tomato one onion hard croutons. Blue cheese dressing didnt taste much like blu cheese. Dont like soft pasta, al dente preferred. Bread average.
I can't wait day I walk away $120/person steak dinner feeling like I got I paid for. This wasn't it.
I came birthday dinner. I impressed all. First off, sat booth near host podium. He seemed bad mood made us feel uncomfortable. I like nice touch name printed menu service waitress good. However, food wise, OK bit disappointing. I course filet, I underwhelmed it. The flavor meh black truffle butter surprisingly boring. After experience, I desire ever come restaurant again.
We find Morton's 4 times year. The food rarely let down. The steaks perfect, potatoes delicious, desserts die for. However, service, rather servers, leave lot desired. To put bluntly, consistently better servers Applebee's Outback. The men waited us Pittsburgh Morton's act hate there. We often feel like we're prodding information speak us unless absolutely to. Our recent visit three nights ago worst service date. The server lazy, far laid back, truly working expensive establishment. We asked questions special (he denied one was), chicken dish (his response Chicken Christopher prepared - "It's, like, well, ya know, regular fried chicken"....he could made sound less appealing it's definitely nothing like regular fried chicken), way dessert served (he told fruit crisp absolutely berries, ordered served apples), obviously put questions. The price meals service absolutely line location.
Allow preface saying I don't like giving bad reviews. But since Morton's chain restaurant, I'm sure opinion won't force close shop. Its call arms anything. Our recent meal Morton's, elevated price points long-standing tradition, disappointing, plain simple. I would inclined blame Restaurant Week, wife ordered normal menu. The beef substandard, tasting like sirloin Chili's supposed high-quality cuts Morton's claims shill. When I bit side order broccoli, floret half-warm half-cold. The thing keeping rating 3 stars lower pleasant service received. When spend amount money equals half normal shopping trip one meal, expect much received visit. Simply put, horrible value. Extremely disappointed food, Morton's. Your move.
Terrible Value steaks good. $13 Caesar Salad tasteless dressing probably came bottle. $13 side dishes. But crazy $89 bottle Acacia Pinot Noir that's $20 State Store. A mark-up 4 1/2 times retail. Insane. No drinks. No dessert coffee. So bill 2 salads, 2 steaks, 2 sides bottle average wine $310. Probably worst value around.
We dinner tonight disappointed. We party 15 service slow ended serving cake ourselves. The food bland best. They children's menu. The thing efficient valet service. We won't back.
For normal maintenance, inspections auto related service, check guys out. I couldn't happier experience. Labor rate quoted $65 per hour, approx half would dealer corporate garage.
I called last minute state emission inspection took in. All together came around $99 didn't try sell anything crazy.
The crew amazing! They squished late inspection car back night. Very honest trustworthy! Extreme well priced! You won't disappointed!!!
Although I've never menu items except gyro, I wish I would gone elsewhere. Since I comment gyro; goes... First, meat embroiled fatty particles (it's fake meat something), second; don't include enough dressing, third; way, way many onions, forth; two small slices tomatoe, fifth; feta cheese crumbled patty, sixth; pile stuff top pita, - quite honest, tastes bad.
Was excited get pizza today. It's months since last order. Very disappointed quality I got. Pizza burnt 1side done other. How sad So happy. What happened here!!! Used best I've ever had. Now settle second best street

This place seriously took order delivery, charged card taking last $15 (hard times) call back 30 minutes later saying don't deliver street!!!! So son I won't eat tonight idiots can't properly train staff list 'do deliver ' streets!!! Thanks wise guys!!! I'm literally tears wondering I'm going feed kid tonight...
"grossest hostess" Okay, know go place it's close closing time? You aren't sure whether staff cordial inviting straight rude. Well wife I went Millers 9:15 pm dinner. The hostess incredibly rude directly bat. said "ughhhh know it's close closing time, right"? wife said, "what time close"? The older, short blond curly haired hostess glasses said "we close ten". TEN??? TEN???? They weren't closing 45 minutes!!!! This second time us last lost business good. We even heard phone ring quarter ten didn't even answer phone, picked snarled "closed" hung person! Our server however, spot food decent hostess manager whatever left worst taste moths spoiled Millers Seafood forever. If go Miller's Seafood see front, turn run!
I eaten twice. Both times I thought food sub-par. The first time birthday lunch lousy, I feeling weather, I gave another try year later dinner. It lousy lunch. My wife definitely agreed, although walk 15 minutes, never eat again.
I remember going I little kid celebrate grandparents' 50th wedding anniversary. I thought place "fancy" many years ago I remember going back play nearby park I also thought really cool. When I moved Pittsburgh, I moved Brighton Heights Miller's located I went years ago ok. I decided give another shot night I really regret it. I ordered fried fish sandwich even though crisp outside point somewhat burnt yet inside cold fish weird texture like maybe freezer burnt really old. The place dingy poorly lite, looks dirty overall experience downright unpleasant. No, no. That all.
Terrible. I lived 2 blocks away - options - I still can't bring order here. Ordered twice last 90 days times terrible. Ended waiting hour time. First time I got home find totally different order; send time waited 1.5 hrs pizza. Both crappy, best. Staff really rude times.
We moved couple blocks away thought we'd try out. Their prices great but, seriously, worst customer service I've ever seen. I walked guy finish cell phone game helping me. I get home realize given wrong pizza. When I called see correct one guy tells that's ordered. I assured didn't, I girlfriend called order in. He said "sorry man" didn't offer solutions. So picked garbage toppings didn't order threw away. It would've taken little effort fix us. All took hour make thing. I'd go back I desperate it's seriously amateur hour.
Too much cheese pizzas, customer service incredibly poor. This nothing new, Brighton Heights many years. My husband LOVES buffalo chicken pizza, last experience waiting hour pick up, would order Chubby's every local pizza joint closed.
We ordered delivery live around corner. It came cold sauce tasted year old plastic Rubbermaid container. The meatball sub bitter gamey. Never again. Ever.
This review Sam Bok food stand. I found review (kind of) I feel though it's good enough review. PLUS, gal China Express (now closed, downtown) cooks there, I make happen. This place simple. It chicken stick, mung bean pancakes, & I think sort spring roll. The thing I've ever tried chicken stick, really, it's I need. little thingers delicious, they're $3. They two different sauces dump it, I get both; one sort Korean BBQ sauce & Sriracha. Then it's wrapped foil, handed off. Make sure get extra napkins, they're messy. Any time I run strip get staples, I inevitably swing get chicken stick. You too...you won't regret it.
Korean / Asian grocery. Small little bit everything.
Very unprofessional. Hard contact. Walked job work completed done properly. The crew also unprofessional. I don't even think licensed. I think crew amatuer laborer Hancock hired job. Also, alcohol air too. I shocked see happening work completed. They return fix problem return money paid it.
Awful workmanship. Nothing accordance specs. Took money. I wasn't one. Check BBB. Very disappointed.
Original post written September 2015 - I don't recommend company. Poor quality work. They put new floors prior painting, splattered paint them, installed new pipes clawfoot tub close wall I couldn't fit baseboard behind it, workers smoked inside work, never cleaned themselves. I walked bedroom painted washed walls rolling paint dirt cobwebs. These handful examples issues I had. At time posting gone almost month past contract end date, it's dragging on. Talk contractors area let know company's reputation. I wish I had. One positive: stayed within budget, cost sanity quality work? I would never use again. ***Update: June 2016 - They still installed final window supposed to. It's custom window order according window company still sitting warehouse. Every weeks I try call text John ask they'll putting in, never hear back.
I cant believe I requested snail mail menu building could decide new caterer lunches dinners received 0 tenant council still looking new caterer since another Disastrous thanksgiving dinner w another caterer.! I cant believe menu requested even gave phone# & address 1 month 0 thank 0 I tell council use since didn't get menu w prices foods. This job would every holidays lunches dinners
Honestly, it's pretty unassuming outside. Inside it's tiny greek diner, albeit "Americanized" choices menu. Hello buffalo chicken gyro! But craving fixin' stuffed cabbage, potato pierogies, halushki, place. And dirt cheap too. I think total bill like $10. Obviously you'll get traditional gyro's well, twist buffalo chicken one. Obviously, I'm intrigued. They also sell ice cream, I wasn't full meal, I definitely would indulged in!
Very disappointed. Delivery late, gyros cold fries soggy. I wont ordering again.
This probably worst Gyro I ever had. Even frozen ones sold supermarkets better this. Extremely dry, tasteless, obviously fresh I watched woman cut top thin spindly piece meat left microwave serving me. I never go back place I recommend it. Stay away, Gross distasteful
The food NOT used be, less stellar way priced!! Not place I remember, super gyro (was ok) pizza boat ($11.50 mediocre cooked pizza boat??) fried mushrooms (were tasty) small chicken salad fermented olives=$30?? Wow!!! Me 2 children could walked around corner eat n park better experience, that's I recommend do. I don't like bash food joints I won't back! I'm hard please, make tasty give value.
Stopped oil change told couldn't open hood. Went road Jifffy Lube problem opening hood gave discount. Sorry Pennzoil, think lost customer.
Standard Pittsburgh dive. They Yuengling, Newcastle Guinness tap basketball television complaints.
Stopped checking various Asian grocers strip first time. They bigger selection Japanese tsukemono (pickled veggies) I've seen store thus far, along Oden kits, varieties fish cake good variety sauces soy sauce. It one smaller stores, however I personally could find everything I would need prepare several staple Asian dishes. The highlight visit: chicken stick. I weary simple name I took bite luscious, caramelized chicken juicy marinade oils flowed chin. Not mention, it's gigantic skewered piece meat $3.50.
I love home made food ;p Extremely small..but better nothing... areas don't even sell Korean foods.. I went hoping little oriental food shopping... I heard sold Korean food, there's products general shop would well...don't come here..if looking specific products...stuff priced...and place really limited comes produces...kinda disappointing...
"Divey" decent beer selection. Located West Liberty Ave, locals walk non locals trouble finding parking. Bagged snacks available, good amount televisions walls, Bucs, steelers, pens games game time. No idea serve food. Wasn't long enough, long enough ninety minute IPA waiting someone finish tax preparation H&R Block street. Just realized 500th review Yelp! Go me!
YUM! As I aimlessly walking downtown frigid cold I realized I needed stop somewhere new lunch! I usually head Gateway Center Cafe I pack lunch since it's cozy (comfy chairs, couches, soap operas oh my!) Today I went decided try lunch. I noticed giant salad bar many many options. I headed Entree line. There menu board 3 options, $6.40. It included: 1) Entree, 1 side, drink 2) Entree, 2 sides 3) Entree small salad bar. The entrees I went were: penne pasta & sauce, pork & kraut juicy, buffalo chicken sandwich. I chose buffalo sandwich course awesome salad bar. Even though I ordered small salad, filled quick. I still sandwich sitting next haha. I added healthy load toppings extremely satisfied & full afterwards. Note: might hard find-- look across street Gateway T station you'll see steps heading downstairs. That's you'll find cafe. Also, you're brown bagger dont want sit desk, it's extremely cozy there. There also microwaves (score!) haha!
Ok. Two stars I better experiences here. This particular visit absolutely awful! I ordered dirty martini. Risky. But I seen couple others drinking it, bad could be? So I took swig I could have, have, ran door. It dirty I could barley contain myself. The "container" olive juice came red flag right there. Needless say, I sick whole night next day. Just order bottled beer. That's safe route.
Another patron decided blue I stolen started physically attacking me. The staff completely ignored it. I literally run front door call police another bar get stuff back. I going bar twelve years happened. Never again. This gathering place human garbage anymore.
If look Yelp reviews I NEVER give 1 star, worst costumer service experiences I've entire life. The entire staff rude. They made us feel like inconvenience. From lady reservation desk frowned, snarled, barked commands like prison, embittered woman supposed help run insurance information, experience made feel belittled terrible. Before arriving checked insurance companies America's Best would honor insurance, got lady said take insurance. After BEGGING PLEADING call insurance company finally frowning told us wrong America's Best actually take insurance. We disgusted experience here. We called corporate office (something I never do) afterward told contacts arrive go back location. The people corporate office actually really nice shipped North Hills location instead. When went pick contacts North Hills staff pleasant, little late. The downtown office ruined America's Best forever. Honestly, I telling everyone I know never go sub par establishment.
What hidden gem South Hills. This fun Little store carters wide range spiritual curiosities. You explore psychic side modest selection power crystals, tarot cards scents. I found selection books helpful spanned wide range interest.
From previous reviews I read I know exactly people talking about. I rarely give one two stars. The customer service horrible. I feel like everything I say wrong. I felt rushed selecting frames. They changed $10 price marked frame. When I pointed I got attitude.
Edit: A customer service representative central office called able arrange refund manager Pittsburgh location. Still, I think location deserves one star, considering one employees actually lied return policy, saying sales final, another one said "I don't know you're talking about" I tried explain problem. Very poor customer service location. Despite says website (30-day return policy), location refuses take returns, even defective product. I got set eyeglasses reflections across field vision. They're barely usable due this. If I sit near bright window, I three reflections show lens. These reflections go directly across center field vision. $200 drain. Buyer beware.
I got eye exam two pairs expensive eye glasses Pittsburgh Downtown branch. It horrible experience. Firstly sold sample pairs without telling me, I paid $350 two pairs, I received eye-glasses luckily I understood problem them, I went back store, insist new pairs, I asked see samples coincidence anymore. I asked check inventory, agreed samples. I choose new two pairs, models already low quality old fashion. I chose one Rayban one Calvin K. priced market. I go store three times, means three days permission office, I deal w parking downtown, horrible rude customer service. I think took advantage me, international student. I writing comment save people.
Ordered soup today $5.19 charged $1.19 baguette usually get free salad. Surprised didn't come soup. Soup decent (Chicken Noodle). They 8 choices day. This place gold mine limited nearby options outside Qdoba Mcdonalds pizza places. Add iced tea bill almost $10. Crazy!
I excited come store I moved neighborhood I LOVE stores like this. Not fantastic selection pretty decent. The merchandise weirdly organized. I go today picking groceries tell need hold purse bad groceries. Which sure, I guess that's ok. My problem I feel like I targeted. There another woman purse didn't ask hold stuff. There something I wanted buy I ended leaving minutes half hearted browsing. It left bad taste mouth.
I stayed Pennsylvanian month one Corporate Apartments. This place old. I believe used hub trains buses. The outside looks nice hallways rooms look little dingy. There mildew floors bathroom bathtub. The washer dryer old. There rust door hinges. The dresser, fixtures, coffee table, dining table, dining chairs looked new modern. The carpet part clean. The sofa looked old comfortable. The bedsheets yellow stains them. I use comforter one layers. The Pennsylvanian maid service option 1 week 2 week intervals. I sure even changed washed bedsheets yellow stains? wtf? The views apartment nice, windows hard see since window screens dirty. The kitchen ok. The corporate apartment comes fullsized fridge, dishwasher, coffee maker, silverware, platewear, pots pans. There also iron ironing board. There also 22 inch? CRT-TV 100 cable channels. I router internet taken away 2 weeks stay. The Pennsylvanian claimed Comcast took away without even telling me. They offer chance pay it. The fitness room nice. There treadmills, elliptical machines, pullup bars, various machines. There even sets dumbells. I never used sauna, I cannot comment that. There 24 hour concierge always helpful friendly. There also option sign dry-cleaning service, outsourced another company. You drop dirty clothes room pick days later cleaned. This rather expensive well. Everyone dry-cleaning Key access room. Thieves could come steal clothes. If I option, I would stay Pennsylvanian again.
I really like Saks. It's close job I time! Antoine takes care clothing purchases every time I there. Tom guy Bond no.9. He sends postcards telling new Bond fragrances store Bond events time. He always hooking free sample I come in! Reshonda girl fragrances. If I want try something don't sample make one right spot! Now that's service! I would give store 5 put interior SUCKS! It small needs major updating. It looks like Kaufmann's, Gimbel's Horne's back 80's. The fragrance counter small. The men's section basement half floor men's. The rest house ware. The majority men's section suits. Can get Gucci Prada clothing shoes? They really need expand move across street old Lord & Taylor building!
Much like rest Pittsburgh, lots friendly folks staffing place. And unlike California, tax clothes!! There smallish selection, major Saks-quality brands -- theory, DVF, Marc Jacobs, Prada, etc.. Good amt sale items department. Sadly, 60 years store moving late next year.. Sad loss DT Pittsburgh.
I never really shopped downtown location, I sad see go. Now Nordstrom upscale department chain have, isn't magical window shopping Saks wishing could afford cosmetics clearance rack. RIP :'( (I score Alexander Wang bag $350 liquidation sale, good came it.)
Don't waste time.1- dont sell regular paper hardly poster paper.2- really hard find thing use. Most things archaic cool vintage way.3- owner bitch. During park(ing) day 2010 waited 3 hours coming telling artist " find discussing. I dont support tree hugger shit...." extraordinarily rude.
Kuhn's seems like pride "Family" themed grocery store. I've Kuhn's quite times, since located close me, found products much expensive grocery stores, I understand take pride offer customers buy produce locally. But, me, cheap ass, I don't care get products, I really care price. And prices expensive. The store small cramped, I get confused easily find products. I like friendly atmosphere inside Kuhn's though, employees seem really nice eager please talk you, I'll give three stars. But friendliness, I'm going Aldi, stuff MUCH cheaper..
I shopped several times, time I've encountered bad service rude staff. I ordered printed invitations. When I picked up, I interrupted whole staff coffee break, seemed irritated. Another time, several items price tags, took forever find price me. The final straw recent visit, three customers, line checkout, essentially ignored. The man works (also rudest, experience) told us he'd minute. Five minutes later still ignored. The women front line waiting ten minutes. FINALLY, someone wandered back rang items. She said man told us wait helping "a important wedding." I guess customers aren't equal. I won't bother shopping again. The high prices poor treatment don't add up.
I customer store many, many times past. I go ONLY source yarn downtown area I'm avid knitter. I put rude employees dirty store this. I actually little excited moved I looking forward visiting clean store. Here mistake happened. I recommended coworker. She called ask moved (I unsure address it's website yelp). When asked woman ansered phone could tell moved woman hesitated said, yes I guess. I'm sure thought funny. Then simply said located Gulf Tower. When coworker asked woman LAUGHED said rude tone, Grant street. My coworker lived Pittsburgh year, know PIttsburgh easist city learn. When pressed information location woman nerve raise tone voice tell coworker building 100 years! Sad, very, sad. They absolutly DESTROYING reputation!
Kuhn's really convenient grocery live great selection higher end lunch meats, etc., I terrible experience poultry. It took several minutes sort grey, fatty boneless, skinless chicken breasts I finally found package didn't appear spoiled, I came home find breasts never cut breasts. There several large pieces ton trimming done. Drive extra distance Giant Eagle need anything meat department.
A heavy hand touches everything Mama Lucia's, unfortunately generosity toppings serving sizes end hurting final product. I stopped lunch ordered 2 slices (one pepperoni olives mushrooms sausage) side salad. Both slices nice size, however, way served created awkward eating situation. Rather topping two individual slices topped half 4 cut pizza match order. The slices also odd shape, essentially chode pizza world (wider long). This made nearly impossible pick eat hand without getting sauce ear ear. They also violated number 1 pizza sin overloaded slices cheese. This made doughy center crust slightly undercooked. Their loading cheese didn't stop pizza. My side salad came topped honest cup half mozerella cheese. Underneath white blanket huge handful red onion, tomatoe slice, bland iceburg. On positive note, make great homemade vinegarette. Each day week $3 lunch special. One co-workers always goes Wednesday lasagna (a portion may fit shoe box). I'd try Mama Lucia's sandwich pasta, I'm staying away pizza salad.
I haven't Kuhn's months forgot much I prefer grocery stores area. Once get past craziness parking lot it's bad. It's smaller grocery stores around still ample choices produce/meat/dairy/deli needs fo sho. Their prices less expensive GE too! If fuel perks... The service always fast friendly. I'll rest thanksgiving shopping here. They good deals going right now. .99lb Honeysuckle turkeys min purchase!
Great pricing food! A hoagie, fries, & drink $6 & change. They different daily specials day week. Monday= 6in meatball... wed =I love buffalo chicken horead agie chicken parm hoagie. Their calzones look good. I often order cash fry (chicken, fries melted mozzarella cheese. You add veggies small price) Also, seem full downstairs, entire 2nd floor seating. No worries!
Had friend went here. REALLY BAD experience
I appointment there, showed up, hair dresser didn't even show up! The owner one took appointment. Somehow got lost? They hot mess. I never go again!
Not worth money. Poor service, worn interior, A/C non-functional, THE CD PLAYER DIDN'T WORK, AND THERE WAS NO AUXILIARY JACK. They get two start managed get us Point A Point B without making us fear lives.
I don't know ya'll know Peppis kicks shit Primanti Brothers! I mean come on, hoggie named Big Ben named spec's hoggie regular years! Big Ben! This House Prime Rib Hoggie spots! Don't get sprung!
I came tonight ready buy bike. In fact, I called see specific bike I looking for. There plenty workers there, I waited around ten minutes I left. I really disappointed. It I leaving guy asked I needed help. Maybe I woman? The people getting help tonight two guys. What terrible experience. I'm glad I took money elsewhere.
Peppi's leave peppy. The wait cheesteak sandwich long. I came lunch rush still waited around 20-25 minutes. The sandwich o.k. I got steak special includes, beef, cheese, onions, peppers, lettuce, mayo. The meat comes frozen rectangled thin patty. It fried, chopped up, ingredients added. Half fries burnt half soggy. The restaurant typical dive many Pittsburgh Steelers paraphernalia.
updated
I found short black curly hair basket fries... definitely mine. Needless say, completely ruined meal. Thanks Peppi's, I won't eating anything isn't ready-to-eat (like fruit) next days. Not shop LOOK grimey, IS grimey... Completely disgusted.
I like double cooked wings, they're like chick wings they're mini. The thing turns place cardboard disposable bowls complimentary popcorn - however get upset u try use put wing bones things insist wiping & reusing disposable bowls. Disgusting & totally unsanitary IMO. If insist reusing those, imagine cutting corners behind closed kitchen doors. I'd go back bottled beer, that's it.
The sandwiches great staff friendly, place absolutely filthy. Your feet stick floor tables dirty. Would strongly recommend TO GO order.
Racism it's finest. The owner refuses take care black people. I appalled I witnessed myself. I'll never go again.
Not sure people see it's never again. I party 8, appetizers frozen bag, waitress messed 2 orders, steaks came wrong made us pass drinks other. It busy times couldn't find her. The rest wait staff seemed irritated I get another waitress find sitting conversation table us. If want decent bar find may well make drink burger home call night instead waisting time place.
What draws ambiance. It transports grungy neighborhood caffe typically found Italian small towns villages. In words, place charmless room awash harsh fluorescent lights. It couple high tables seats (well, weather good, outdoor seats). The regulars take espresso standing, half chatting other, half watching whatever RAI programming showing TV. In addition espresso/cappuccino/latte, I recommend freshly squeezed juice. I don't know why, taste better others. I also like get breakfast pastry bakery next door.
The coffee isn't bad, it's destination spot, especially 21st Street Coffee two blocks away. If it's raining you're caught public market aways 21st street, it's worth cup.
I ugly haircut. For $60 owner. Trusted reviews, look like 70s rock star. No hair sides long back!
I previously written positive review Karen salon, must change recent experience turned nightmare. A months back, reading great reviews work, I went haircut. I pleased, I went back highlights trim. This time around I extremely upset. Karen left color hair way long. And request trimming ends turned short layers front going back past ears long back. Think Carol Brady Brady Bunch. She also thinned hair out, I absolutely hate hair already thin. Now I frizzy, uneven ends stick different lenghts. There also bleed marks color noticeable hair line. The worst damage caused processed. I severe breakage everywhere especially top. I ton hairs sticking top head hair looks frizzy fried. It continues break. I went showed Sergio owner laughed saw saying new hair growth, breakage. Even I explained like hair done salon stuck guns. I would like say I disappointed what's happened. But I upset. Every girl knows feels like bad experience salon. Now I appointment another salon pay money fix color, brassy, highlights bled cut already paying $150 mess I left lift. I much regret ever trying salon.
I made appointment Sergios hearing good things acquaintances. I made appointment specifically get extensions cut hair. When I made appointment week before, receptionist said don't usually cut extensions don't put that, asking someone salon could me. I made appointment 6pm. They called 1:17 asking I hadn't shown 1 pm appointment. I told 6 said sorry able accommodate 6. When I arrived, I seated quickly greeted stylist. She said cut color? I explained no, I made appointment extensions cut in. She excused spoke owner, Sergio. When returned minutes later explained would cutting hair cut extensions don't put I didn't like cut they'd pay extensions. I even offered sign liability waiver refused. So basically, I wasted time getting work early come salon refused service scheduled for. What complete waste time. If don't something make sure staff knows that. It's shame get bad review dont confidance staff proper hair cut
Do go week expect open time. I today 615am employees all. Managed poorly. The older lady short hair cut one doesn't open time scheduled. Please move lady different time. 6am early her.
Out 200 reviews, I've written 14 1 star reviews. that's .07%. That means I never really write 1 star reviews. La Prima Espresso Strip District gets one. :( They've got good coffee I never back, bc older woman barista morning unforgivably rude, without reason. The coffee good, I would liked become regular, I dont want start every morning dealing nasty attitude. Yesterday rolled eyes I asked lots room cream. I former barista. I *know* asking room cream one difficult special requests gets! If hate public, shouldn't work them. This morning takes cake, I won't back. Here's happened: I walked in, talking gentleman obviously regular. Because busy bc I've barista'd myself, I waited patiently. And waited waited. It minutes, eternity really need coffee! She never even looked me. Then sudden goes, "Okay lady going stand want coffee?" WTF. I liked sense urgency, seriously? Rude. I asked medium coffee large cup, that's possible, medium coffee lots room. Not hearing me, goes, "What that?" older gentleman said, "She wants medium sized coffee large cup." And woman turns snaps, "And couldn't repeat yourself?" Even guy talking to, regular, like, "Whoa." He tried make excuse her, like, "She's fired today!" Then woman slams coffee counter. Was bad day? Am I doppleganger someone hates? I dont know, I don't care. I believe may owner surely fired now, posts complaints her. "Do go week expect open time. I today 615am employees all. Managed poorly. The older lady short hair cut one doesn't open time scheduled. Please move lady different time. 6am early her." I won't ever back. If that's spunky personality, well, personality sucks. Seriously lady, you're morning person. You ask later shifts.
Sushi Three located strip shops Beverly Road, alongside coffee shop, florist, several banks, two pizza places. This Little Tokyo are, knowledge, sushi restaurants Mt. Lebanon. Sushi Three extensive menu seems expanded since last time I visited, lots sushi. There long list appetizers, tempuras teriyaki dishes, Chinese offerings. The main focus, sushi, takes large portion menu, many different rolls, ranging basic kappa rolls complex southside roll (shrimp, smoked eel, fish flakes, cucumber, spinach, mushrooms, egg caviar). As vegetarian, I appreciate vegetable sushi platter, I never seen anywhere else costs $12. There even separate vegetarian menu. While I appreciate wide-ranging menu, I can't like atmosphere. It's always quiet dark inside, I always get feeling cave. I prefer get take-out delivery. Overall, I prefer Little Tokyo, Sushi Three's improved menu large number vegetarian options, rating may change soon.
Sushi selection limited... Miso soup tasted little fishy.
This place come close making cappucino like would get Italy. Go coffee, stay hear men speaking Italian.
Went try coffee. Usually go Allegheny Tea Coffee Exchange. It's true service get ruin experience. Will probably never go person servicing rude.
Basically, don't need fake ID get in/aren't interested pedophilia ... don't bother.
Everyone loves bitch Pegasus I enjoy small doses. It's 18+ club, you'll get lots attitude pretentiousness, exchange get lots eye candy. Drinks expensive, it's busy Fridays. But it's real gay dance club Pittsburgh fills niche nicely. Occasionally electro goth type bands perform well.
We used call place Tons Sluts. Because pretty much, that's is. There's fence fences bar... it's.. ridiculous. It's cheap. I went drag shows. But you're looking wild drag show cheap drinks head Blue Moon L-Ville Butler Street
I'd nail appointment set several weeks - first time customer. Less hour appointment I got call canceling it. Not owner apologizing cancellation trying correct situation somehow, nail tech. She told owner insisted SHE call clients tell "personal problems" day couldn't make it. Wow. The lack professionalism astounded me. On positive side, I'm glad I experience BEFORE may worst nail experience life. Imagine "personal problems" may affected work. I called salon let know disappointment left high dry. They simply didn't care. They lost customer....not nails, services offer. Not best way run "service" business!
Worst Brazilian wax I ever gotten. Extremely Painful inefficient, still red welt 3 days later. She also used stick entire time sanitary. Eyebrow waxing significantly overpriced $18. Do go waxing!
Working Fifth Avenue Place downtown affords lot different coffee options. Ranging multiple Crazy Mocha locations, Starbucks, burnt swill free, little individual places like this. Fifth Avenue Beanery kiosk type place first floor building. It says "coffee roasters" unless they're roasting beans site, I haven't seen roasting equipment. There one woman regularly others different days/times week. They offer re-useable mug save waste also provides small discount drinks. Admittedly I've pumpkin pie latte, salted caramel latte, black coffee. The drinks always hot espresso strong. If happen building, make sure cash (no cards) stop by.
Fifth Avenue Beanery type coffee spot suits convenience quality, putting par Crazy Mochas Starbucks area. It's hardly knock, lower prices, I'd rather enjoy espresso, etc. small stand places nearby...especially I'm hurry...and cash hand (it's cash only). The staff isn't coffee snob, uber-prideful-of-their-craft school baristas, don't expect greatest pull ever photo-worthy latte art (you won't get chains, either), they're really nice worth supporting. If you're looking quick cup coffee espresso pick-me-up cash pocket, I definitely recommend Fifth Ave Beanery. If you're looking better-quality drink, might disappointed. If like Starbucks Crazy Mocha, support little guy Fifth Avenue Beanery chance.
I go frequently. The baristas nice prices generally reasonable. I've taken stars they've recently hiding sweeteners. I guess concerned theft, it's really annoying ask every time opposed self service station used have. As update, one barista gave dirty look I grabbed sweetener myself. Sorry I didn't feel like waiting three customers. Either let get ask every single customer want wait them. I likely give business again. There plenty coffee tea places around people don't settle here.
The Chinese supermarket Pittsburgh. Thank goodness it's well stocked. Unfortunately it's 30 minute bus ride school hauling goods back easy. I feel home here, even smells Asian!
My go place Asian product needs. Not mention fact produce among freshest The Strip! Lotus one regular shopping haunts. I would lost without them!!!
Green-leaf vegetables & rice much cheaper here. You find almost every common food/flavour selling China, even freezed dumplings. Get meat/potatoes/tomatos/onions next door Wholey.
Lotus Food still go cheap vegetables, tofu Asian ingredients however workers aren't friendliest - don't take personal. I went register, said hi woman gave glazed look, scanning anything confused me. Behind comes another customer apologies tells forgot items. I told I sorry I aware still checked replies "You wouldn't known" smile. And even transaction I continued receive glazed look.
After unpleasant experience Lotus Grocery 17 February 2014, I want caution customers careful paying cash store. My order $3.08. I gave glum cold middle aged female cashier $10.10. She put $10 bill till gave $2.02 change, would correct I given $5 bill. I told I gave ten dollar bill, repeatedly insisted I not. I went mean middle aged man appears manager owner told problem. He interested hearing eventually fell lap short, middle aged woman also appears manager, one nicer people staff. I got nowhere I asked count register receipts. The woman appears management suggested I leave phone number I would called store closes count completed. That acceptable me. I asked count conducted I waited agreed. As counted recounted, I waited patiently. She ultimately concluded I right gave $5.00. She apologized multiple times; clerk would cheated $5 not. I careful shopping store. I try pay one dollar bills future announce much money I handing cashier. There bitter taste mouth Lotus Grocery. Of places happen, would one language barrier employees dismissive customer. This Giant Eagle!
If I give haft star I would. Never shop Asian grocery since Many open. Owner employee alike manners nasty. Sorry guys it's truth.
I strongly recommend store rudeness. The middle aged woman man seem like manager extremely mean without manner. I recommend Asian markets.
Wanting hella Asian snacks around night! located near hotel! This place A ok... basic Asian needs comes supermarket...too bad there's lot Rude ass employees working gets dame nerves! place become popular Asian Supermarket since located strip.... I'd say it's bigger cleaner looking compared Asian stores around Pittsburgh... While you're there...check produce out...fresh overpriced!
Used lot. Not anymore though. Not food attitude cashiers. Every time I check out, freely throw foods I took time pick carefully. One time box sponge cakes came open, checking out, cashier touched cake inside put checkout bag. So Gross! Staff definitely really rude. Try come unless it's emergency.
If looking ingredients asian cooking I definitely recommend taking trip lotus! They wide selection items even giant eagle (or whatever store) items too, prices lotus probably better. Of course depends, example: Identical lychees Giant eagle: ~$4.45 Lotus:~$2.20 Crazy! It's also fun browse try something new. If need curries, tapioca pearls, tofu, durian, galanga, dried mushrooms... you'll find here. Just couple random examples. They sweets housewares like certain cups dishes, chop sticks, etc.
Every time I went place, Chinese man looks like he's charge would say something unpleasant me, makes feeling horrible spending one penny here! If hate people close store!
I agree previous reviewer: tailoring trade disappeared oblivion. I can't even find good expensive one. To list number bad tailors experiences I've would take day. As one body conscious girls, know ones-lots clothes closet none ever look good on- seems I'm always needing pin tuck one place another clothes. I buy lot expensive gear online (discounts!) try make work even really doesn't. Seems expensive stuff always stuff breaking well. Thus, I need tailor often. After moving Pittsburgh rural Texas, I excited I might actually find someone could something besides tack together hole (e.g., dry cleaners). I brought five things shop far: two pant hems, tear jeans (not seam), two dresses basic "these look like crap need something done them." She could fix all! And grand total $60. She CASH ONLY hours kind odd (it's one woman gig), accommodating. She took deposit whatever cash I I pay rest I pick up. I gave rush order it's 6 day turn around. She told 12-5 M-F. It's room 1212 Investment Building downtown. I able grab street spot blocks away parking, problem. Highly personable, said mom still teacher-after 20 years this, it's cheap, small customer oriented. I walked I swear sweat shop women sitting 12 desks sewing. That turn off. This nothing like that, it's work room someone specializes trade wants please customers. I return!
Lulu worked bridesmaids dress. It problematic dress; e.g. several sizes big lace overlay. Lulu worked fit should. The bridesmaids dresses altered seamstresses. None altered dresses Lulu; even refused fix problematic areas! I highly recommend Lulu.
Okay first off, I came Lulu 4 weeks prior wedding wedding dress altered. She pleasant first meeting I tried dress look needed altered. She made markings length dress, told she's going take 2 inches waist dress, added straps(per request). After 2 weeks later, I texted (she responds via texts) telling added padding bra area dress I didn't like wiring showing dress (it's fault wiring showing...it something dress delicate). So third week came along (the pick date), texted saying VERY sick asked I pick dress following Monday instead Saturday. I figured days I agreed. So Monday came along, I got text telling I pick 4....She texted I way shop, asking pick dress 5! At point, I desperate get dress back, I drove shop 5...BUT I got another text way shop...saying can't get bed told I pick dress next day (Tuesday) early I want! FINALLY Tuesday, I came shop 9 AM sharp. She apologized sick understand nervous I wedding. I tried dress SUPER SHORT. It 4 inches ground! I told I didn't want short, said thought I wanted poofy dress bustled bottom layer caused short! I told I didn't like short let "some bustle". Also, I struggled get gown took much waist area. AND added soooo much padding bust...that looked super weird. I devastated...but I didn't dare leave dress longer, fear thing happening. To sum review, I take dress another seamstress next day take bustle completely. There time get rest dress fixed I let rest be. I guess I shouldn't tried new seamstress wedding dress stick someone I already know. That big lesson me.
I ordered sympathy arrangement Aunt's funeral. I requested flowers delivered Family viewing Friday 3pm. I arrived disappointed see arrangement I ordered. After two calls florist determined another customer also ordered arrangement Aunt wanted order delivered church Saturday viewing prior funeral. As result someone florist decides deliver flowers requested Friday Saturday. Imagine frustration. I say speaking owner, Jim Ludwig offer still bring arrangement funeral home. ( need viewing time situation sorted out.) He offered discount order 30% acceptable gesture end day really wasn't money. Overall frustrating disappointing customer experience already difficult time family.
Unsatisfied customer! I ordered get well bouquet , pictured arrangement $39.99, I wanted premium arrangement I ordered $59.99 bouquet. How disappointing, lillys, 5 roses, rest carnations baby's breath filler. For $60 plus delivery? Will take business elsewhere future. One star day delivery.
After I expressed disappointment flowers, I get partial refund.. So appears care customer service degree. I'm sure whether I'd try again, I felt I disclose customer service recovery effort.
The new Madonna's disappointing. A co-worker always gives Madonna's rave reviews picked new location lunch date. He talked spices, flavor, service. Well, one three. The service friendly, even lunch rush. I chico chicken quesadilla. For $4.81 (with tax), pretty big quesadilla. However, Monterrey jack, chicken, soft shell. No spices, onions, peppers. It still decent price. But I'm 99.9996% sure chicken can. How would I know? Because I've cheated used canned chicken quiches I rush. It's good canned chicken, c'mon! My lunchmates also complained burritos bland. I'm giving three stars I believe Madonna's (and will) better. P.S. CASH ONLY!
The waitresses surly. It's kind annoying. But food decent. I especially like spaghetti oil garlic. I always forget order salads, though. They need invest salad-spinner, they're watering dressings.
Well, finally tried place Green door High Step! Always seem people going out. Heard one kids OK, cause take buddies. Well, ventured ordered things could share. General Ts0's chicken crisp Ouch spicy...Well, outer crust crisp, chicken hard..hard chew, tasteless somewhat sweet sauce??? The Shrimp Lo Mein Ok shrimp overcooked. The Moo Shu Pork forgettable.
Horrible food. It's hard get good Chinese restaurant around Pittsburgh. I wouldn't recommend dog
Hate give middling review, I ordered I felt like food place. I've much better "fast food" style Chinese food rural areas, I felt disappointed lackluster performance meal. The Good: The fried dumplings amazing wonton soup strangely missing green onions, still tasty. Actually, I'm thinking always dumplings fried like potstickers, really made night. The Bad: I ordered classic General Tso's get good range offered Moo Goo Gai Pan, chicken veggies white sauce (one favorite Chinese dishes). The food was...just ok. The General Tso's sauce bit red color crispy like tasted fine. The white sauce dish sort of...off. I can't even explain it, couple bites I started hating taste. The veggies cooked well, chicken wasn't high quality taste buds got turned whole dish. These classic dishes can't get right worries me. My meal started going downhill around there. The Ugly: I ordered fried steamed rice (again get good sampling), fried rice bad. It brown, really fried (just limp), sparse carrots peas scrambled egg bits (not de rigueur delivery Chinese I love fried rice it). I'm sure happened - use new rice, wet rice, cooked long? Whatever was, horrible. I might try refry tomorrow, still bad I'll probably pitch it. The price I've paid Chinese meals restaurants delivery places I consider little "upscale." So I didn't think I saving money, I getting less quality troubles. There several Asian places area make great food, I don't feel like I need limit one.
I work downtown live close library too. This library sometimes home away home. This cute medium size library. Some employees go beyond excellence level assisting me. I interaction employees front desk. Often I bad day - I often wait really hope one particular lady help me. I cannot remember name short lady short dark brown / black hair. She always greets everybody friendly smile always helpful. If nobody waiting in-line, 30 - 60 second chat. Whenever I stressful day work family - greeting enough make feel better. I also like library branches pick item without traveling one branch another. I got tired lady explained get book branches without traveling. She told couple years ago I definitely taking advantage this. If I say something negative branch - I don't like two people hover around one computer - especially one I sitting next to. Though right patrons too. I generally sit downstairs since often less traffic there.
I'm disappointed experience Carnegie Library! :( I recently became member I enjoy utilizing library resources since I graduated Pitt I needed new library go to. I've trying get copy 100 years solitude past two weeks vacation Saturday. The librarian put list I would get next available copy shipped downtown location. This morning I received email saying book arrived ready pick up! I got library soon opened 8:30 boy I shocked hold me. Not 100 years solitude book book. I disappointed free time I read leisure! The librarian duty told happens ALL time. Well, I'm disappointed shouldn't happen all, especially give title author!
I want like it. But ultimately, took forever get doused sushi various sauces NOT listed menu. As condiment-o-phobic, sushi ruined I didn't feel comfortable enough request fixed. 15$ later, I tossed walked out, miserable.
AAahhh. Why I discordance Pittsburgh Yelpers' opinions sushi places? This place 4 stars. The long line -- one person, Andy, making sushi, makes think it's gem Strip District. Eh. With Andy's Special, variety rolls, made continuous strip seawood (ie inside one roll, outside next), I actually found annoying, rolls fell apart trying separate them. There wasn't flavor -- I laid soy sauce wasabi, avail. I'm annoyed right make funny comments.
As July 25, 2014, sign front said closed permanently.
Being Korean-BBQ lover snob..I needed get Bulgogi/gal-bi fix I Pittsburgh. My search led Sushi-Kim. Oh I wish led astray. This probably one worst tasting Korean Barbecue places I ever to. The beef right color basically bland. The beef short-ribs tasty way tough. I felt like I chew piece 100x I going choke die. I fan food would recommend anyone.
This place mediocre best. Not impressed.
You pay money eat again. They cannot even cook edamame, undercooked cold. I stop eating sushi fear I would sick work morning. Texture temperature fish scared me. Save pain throw money window. Only plus side friendliness service.
First all, foods weren't impressive. I native Korean, hence I know Korean foods be. They pricy well. Their foods tasteful. I understand Koreans place Korean friends don't wanna go place. In addition, one server working really rude bad attitude. It took quite long time ordered foods, I asked reason. Then, Latino server whatever ethnicity answered 'I don't know I. I cooking' tone irritation. Even I pointed attitude, tried pick fight without apology. I don't understand working there. He rude ruined Friday night. The worst part restaurant days later, I found charged 10 bucks amount I signed. It's really frustrating. I won't come back unpleasant pricy restaurant never again.
Absolutely worst sushi husband I ever had. It Gross!!! I don't know use much rice fish wasn't cold. You couldn't pay go back place!
Food completely un-authentic, tasty. Service mediocre. Ambiance fun.
In past, I still living Pittsburgh, would go Korean BBQ almost every weekend. I since found extremely difficult get always reserved one large group another (I'm calling CMU Korean Student Association). Maybe I'm unlucky timing visits. Regardless, I find hard believe upstairs exactly filled groups. Rather I think actually allowing reserve whole floor, unfortunate bad long term business IMO. The menu food OK, tad expensive, better places. I'll reluctantly give 4 stars since I haven't actually able eat year (Maybe next time I'm coming Pittsburgh I call ahead put reservation, Yelpers seem indicate push favor larger reservations).
Hard rate one. The Korean BBQ tasty (though Korean BBQ I've ever had, take worth), sushi awful. The salmon sashimi I last visit terrible. It warm, didn't taste fresh all. Their rolls limited mostly pretty boring. Even simple maki thing, seemed expensive poor quality. On hand, Korean BBQ fun tasty. It's shame available days week. My advice? Skip sushi. Eat BBQ.
If you're mood fresh, tasty sushi, place you. The food delivered us simply inedible. Point blank. My husband I ordered bunch sushi dinner plan tasty leftovers lunch next day, splurged little, spent like $60 various rolls. The presentation pretty pathetic - wilting nori, leading us believe rolls pre-made; hot pink ginger, meaning it's MSG-soaked kind; glue-like rice, can't see individual grains - really horrible smell. When took lid tray, stench rotten fish knocked us back. I honestly gagged. It awful, stared other, amazed spent money pile stinking rot. Determined waste everything, I picked piece spider roll sniff/inspect/try. IT HAD A HUGE HAIR IN IT, wound around crab. Totally disgusting. My husband attempted try inari - tofu rice, right? It tasted like rotten fish, absorbed smells fish rolls. We also ordered vegetable tofu soup, green salad ginger dressing. Can't even believe this, salad leaves brown slimy ends! They actually screwed green salad. The soup tasted like inside aluminum pot, metallic burnt-flavored. Horrible, horrible, horrible. We literally dumped everything garbage disposal. Total waste. We tried call complain, time order delivered, place closed. We calling today get money back. Maybe earn another star right thing refund money.
Their Korean food good price isn't bad (compared korean food restaurants area). Very spacious. They sushi Korean bbq well. Yum!
Being Korean kids I visit Korean restaurants town. Since daughter goes PITT wanted treat daughter Korean food. My family including wife non- Korean always order want represent Korean food others disservice heritage. worst I ever had. Their lettuce one mixing choices meat hamburger meat? Will go back.
I came three times all-you-can eat Korean BBQ twice regular meal. For BBQ, expensive least could try eat ~$22 worth meat kimchi. They ask waste meat, makes sense. I really like kimchi pickled daikon radishes side. To grill galbi, bulgolgi pork, spicy chicken, regular beef pork, squid, shrimp, mushrooms. You also make sauces add garlic onion meat. I would recommend coming regular food. The food good, portion sizes ridiculously small, especially high prices. Their bibimbap doesn't even come rice.
One favorites Burgh almost 20 years.
I sorry say place still STINKS. I work strip often get temped Sushi Kim. I stopped lunch today I person whole place. That tipped off. The last time bad meal, wanted give another shot. I ordered spicy chicken lunch menu. I believe L1......Numbered menu items.....Another tip. My food terrible. The miso soup horrid old, sides awful everything seemed microwaved. AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!!!
I don't give 2 stars often sorry Kim - bitter disappointment. I excited found Sushi place Pittsburgh walking distance apartment. That excitement didn't last long I entered place Monday evening 7pm, realizing I one rather spacious restaurant. Fine, I Sushi craving couldn't care less. Until Sushi arrived. I ordered Spicy Tuna Salmon rolls, came within 2 minutes. Strange? Maybe, super fast chef. Sadly, rolls falling apart soon I looked them, Salmon even tasted... bad. I leave plate, never happened before. On plus side, miso soup okay service attentive, surprising you're one place. As many Korean options Pittsburgh I encourage try Korean BBQ, especially reviews Korean food Kim's Yelp bad. But Sushi - forget it.
Second time I try coming Korean BBQ. Apparently it's offered weekends 4:30. When arrived pretty empty wed night. Very overpriced. I got bim bap bland add tons soy sauce.
Tried place based reviews local paper friends. This place awful. We asked questions server ordered based them. Neither good.y friend said cannot eat real spicy food asked tone down. Her meal hot couldn't eat it. Mine disappointing. The thing I found good plain rice. I also thought extremely priced. Will return.
Great service sashimi bad. I'm even kidding I say I've fresher sashimi, maki nigiri Giant Eagle GetGo's prepared foods. Next time I'll try Korean fare.
Never before. Hadn't even heard it. Inexperienced I was, I expected shown works. One Asian gentlemen pointed instructed, it. Disappointed that. The water I served came plastic cup. What reason would restaurant serve water plastic cup beyond me. Not inspired return, mostly passive lacking service.
Man... Really bad start finish. Service slow horrible. Sushi flavorful all. The rice worst I ever had. I honestly would rather eat day old gas station sushi come again.
Never sushi warm rice, sushi almost fall apart....The hea mool jun gol seafood instant noodle soup... So disappointed.
So I'm Pittsburgh Sunday night, I discover 7/11 doesn't sell beer. Weird liquor laws Pennsylvania. The bar block place closes 6:00pm Sunday. WTF? So I need beer hotel room go get six pack go. The hostess says would expensive, I'm desperate thirsty. $18 six pack Iron City. I gave $20 told keep change. I beer that's mattered.
My grandma season passes here. Every then, decent play here. Most time, leave intermission. Unless, like today, intermission. "Buyer Cellar." Has got boring, annoying, NOT funny, waste time play!!! Couldn't keep eyes open! They need actually watch plays decide put here, instead putting energy getting plays written someone famous?? Another waste time, wait people age get old. I guarantee wasting time theater. You going like PSO.
I'm huge fan weekly alternative periodicals. Unfortunately City Paper vanished scene, it's place weekly paper hits stands nothing ads, music reviews restaurant review. Oh, I miss days In Pittsburgh The City Paper vying readership. What happened edgy, ruffling feathers wit used get stories meant something? Did editor lose touch? Did grow old lose liberal ferocity? Or, every hungry reporter leave town head NYC work The Village Voice, REAL alternative newspaper readers Times. In large college town like Pittsburgh, real alternative weekly covering college sports, national local politics, pop culture, local music scene, computer news, finances...etc. Instead get weekly story, nothing needs much undercover work, nothing would cause local politicians shake boots. Nothing would cause Post Gazette stand take notice. Basically running feel good stories keep City Paper courts. As much I hate Mark Madden, least wrote story City Paper edgy, eye opening, usually correct. The City Paper need new blood, it's 2010 editor needs replaced favor hungrier reporters story worth telling.
We dock boat marina, I love location far point. Dock fees expensive docks, price Fox Chapel marina. Theres restaurant outside seating overlooking marina river, They inside outside storage boats There starting replaces docks new ones. The thing I dont like theres lot boat traffic marina since close way point.
So $200 lunch another $200 gas get thanks saw'd little bald marina rat employee insulting wife sister..... Back story ...we lunch filled boat. Girls decided use bathroom leaving courtesy moved boat gas dock adjacent dock wait them. In response get little piece shit doc man screaming us like lunatic "isn't park ride!"....no idea relevance analogy dbag patronized marina $400....but even asking problem that's got..."this isn't park ride..." So go angry little doc man...to world ...these guys suck...they rude, charge $4.50 gallon gas food sucks... Had I land would ended twisted pretzel floating river screaming wife. Avoid crap hole costs. Hope I see shitbird...I'll park ride foot ass
After reading old reviews I figured change occurred last year gave shot. Went boyfriend biking along north shore trail, didn't tell negative reviews since I REALLY wanted sit along river. The view/environment still pretty, found displeased food service. We got beer battered cod sandwhich (convinced go basic reading bad things food) although enjoyed it, I thought batter doughy uncooked fish, tartar sauce tasted grainy (any giant eagle brand would better). It didn't seem like others crazy food I heard woman behind us complaining dish wasn't cooked would like refund. The beers bottled cold, couldn't complain there, service still poor rushed choose drinks/dishes given second pay. Would thought reviews would changed employees. Overall, I would come beers nice seating, would eat dinner beforehand.
Awful service, overpriced food. Don't waste money! On arrival, waitress seemed lost. Ordered food 3 adults, one kid, food came adults, couple minutes mom asked sons food would coming, waitress said would check, came back said pizza hadnt cooked yet. Cancelled pizza, paid $4 little bowl white lettuce cheese thrown it, fried shrimp expense, looked like cookie cutter frozen shrimp. Spoke manager, horrible attitude found waitress never put pizza order son lied told manager wasnt table ordered food. If give people money, would foolish!
The reason anyone goes restaurant sit deck drink. I want like place badly I keep coming back hoping it'll awesome never is. Like dating someone hot also stupid, it's amazing much patience one there's really good atmosphere. One year I took father birthday. I don't usually call people names waitress complete idiot point felt bad ONLY reason didn't freak completely. She forgot dad's food order. She brought mine, neglected notice dad sitting nothing. The manager came took drinks hte tab, btu didn't help much bc we'd able order one round hour waiting bc waitress come table twice. Then brought dad's steak out, waitress dropped (I felt bad her), apparently last steak. I paid bill left went Eat n Park. The second time I came back service equally terrible, also late summer table literally attacked wasps. Seriously, attacked wasps. My friend got stung. Another time I'd made reservation friends 30th bday said htey didn't reservations could put tables together. When showed up, like I'd never called. The last time I ok, attacked wasps friend I opted patio ordered burgers. The service SUCKS. Getting attacked bees wait server bring ice sucks (holding cold beer bottle sting helps). It sucks here. But atmosphere fantastic! When waitress comes ot hte table, order whole bunch bottled beers nad ok.
Just returned RFBlues, I usually enjoy quite lot. The bartender gave sandwich mistake another customer. No big deal; pink salmon looks lot like white chicken, assuming she's colorblind. I waited. And 2nd drink. Another group 3 people came that, ordered meals, got served entrees. I went bartender asked dinner would coming. She announced "salmon takes longer cook" (than what??? raw salad? I cook; salmon one fastest things earth cook!), "I check that..." It hour now. I got sandwich promptly complaining. A minutes later, I finished salmon, I got side vegetables (apparently vegetables take even longer salmon cook!). All sarcasm aside: one screw tolerable. The second - forgetting even check late order I complained, hour I ordered, not. And yet, I wasn't given least consideration bill.
Not impressed. We arrived 5:30, ordered appetizer beers waited fifth final member party. Ordered dinner 6 pm. Some members party ordered crab legs, came kitchen timely manner. The rest us waited additional 45 minutes manager came explain pizza ordered taking longer expected would "4 minutes". 15 minutes later half party needed leave. They went home hungry unhappy. Luckily beautiful day outside. Good luck Redfin blues. It's even summer yet. Yinz got learning do.
Overpriced, unspectacular food, $7 bottles beer, shoddy, inattentive service... But man, you're gonna find many places sit umbrella, sun, water city, couple beers, peel eat shrimp... Rode bike meet old man. Bike path comes directly dock Definitely don't stop you're rush, budget. Almost left 3 stars... But seriously, still restaurants allow smoking?! Thankfully weren't next table. 2.5 stars.

We went Friday dinner 3 couples. We got early (4:45) pretty much pick tables deck. It self-seating, couldn't 2 open tables next wanted 2 different sections. So, pushed round square table together us. Sat 25 minutes, never server come take drink order. But, 7 servers standing entrance talking almost tables empty. We moved different section shade...still offer drinks get bar. Their happy hour special 5 Miller Lites $15 domestics started $4.50 per bottle. We got pound eat peel shrimp appetizer share - shrimp good type seasoning it. Service slow inattentive night. The server polite made recommendations menu us, around much. Food-Wise, tried lot things menu. I started Redfin Bisque. Described crab, lobster shrimp. The flavor bad, broth 1 tiny shrimp. No crab lobster. Seared Ahi Tuna Sandwich - 2 people group got this. It supposed served rare - completely overcooked medium-well. Shrimp Crab Pizza - 1 couple shared (for $21) left half there. It completely soggy crust tore rest slice. Fish Tacos - 2 people party got these. Good portion sizes, served 'lime' sauce overpoweringly sweet - compared flavor icing cake. The flavors different dishes clashed instead complimenting other. Long story short, won't back. Overpriced beer overpriced, bad food. Dinner conversation Friday night bad food was. Epic fail, Redfin Blues, epic fail.
Cool setting it. The menu huge let down. Not much fresh seafood. Battered fried. Very dark outside well. We didn't care atmosphere didn't actually eat anything. Just glass wine.
The atmosphere great however thats positive. The cobwebs railing outside need taken care of. So gross something I want look eating! The service terrible. In server's defense, pretty late (still within hr closing) worried cleaning getting ready close shouldn't excuse pay attention customers. We go inside hunt server pay check got impatient waiting him. The food definitely nothing brag about. The cheese fries nacho cheese, lobster bisque thin cooked tomato flavor crab cake acidic, hiding crab flavor. Overall, pretty mediocre place I would recommend food.
In running one worst restaurants Pittsburgh. If it's first time city, please don't go here. Looks great outside everything else terrible. As group four waited hour table even though saw multiple tables left vacant. When approached host it, lied claimed texted called us notify us table available. We received calls messages. This 2016, "oh I tried call you" excuse doesn't work anymore. Bar service terrible server Amy actually great. Food decent view alright. Bottom line: believe bad reviews don't waste time place.
This place sucks- host jerk waited hour table wait app. They turned wait said tried call me. They lied. The food sucked. Basically don't come here...ever
Went yesterday day boating. Peel eat shrimp dry tough, fresh. Ordered crab cakes, dry crab tasted old well. Might good place drinks, overpriced old food enjoyable. Will returning.
This place needs one shows "rescue" business themselves.
Saw bad reviews wary. Worst part certainly slow service busy night. I vegan ordered vegetable pizza without cheese didn't say vegan/allergy. The chef could made pizza made waiter double check didn't want sauce also 'a little' cheese. This might seem small means everything. Sausage pizza good brother. Red Fin Sandwich brother best sandwich he's EVER HAD. The buffalo shrimp loaded fries mom decent. Bleu cheese/caeser salad dad decent well. The view definitely nice prices weren't terrible.
Stopped looking furnish new apartment. I customer place weekday afternoon. I never greeted sales staff acknowledged. There older woman younger woman working. As I browsing jewelry older woman said loud enough I could hear younger sales associate watch I didn't steal anything. And I'm white young professional I imagine people treated.
sorry average rating... it's store bit overly Feminin. much guys here. 5 star girls, go every year, least Christmas presents. seems lot kind thing days. even though store around quite while.
The people and/or work racist discriminates races. If aren't Vietnamese don't expect customer service plain courtesy. There aren't price tags products prices vary depending much want charge individual. Be really careful don't speak Vietnamese really hike prices say bad things Vietnamese asking prices are. How customers know prices nothing posted labeled? There refund policy time get refund Vietnamese. Also watch let return products paid visa credit card, make sure get refund receipt else keep money. The store dirty shelved products sitting years date. I'd give store negative stars option.
Since Pamela's crazy packed sunny Saturday, girlfriend I decided snack good ol' street food. The stall front grocery handful items - rice, noodles, chicken skewers mung bean pancakes. Always game try something new, I went pancake $2.50 hard go wrong. It fluffy onion inside, nice crispy edges contrast. It packed good bit heat well, wasn't overpowering. If you're Strip looking tasty bite go, hit Kim Do!
When I arrived Denham & Co, salon appointment one counter even acknowledged arrival. 2 girls chatting away,and gave quick glance bothering them. looked around salon wasn't I would expect downtown salon. looked rather like barber shop. staff didn't look professional either. waiting minutes,a hairstylist came asked I needed assistance rather rude tone,as I bothering him. decided leave. don't even think girls even paid attention left. later day,i run friend tried salon before. comments, I'm glad I decided leave. To truthful,I don't understand make money. Very poor service atmosphere. thumbs down!
I hate write mean reviews, I really receive worst haircut life (no hyperbole) place, one really can't fixed I wait grow out. I walked long hair normal-looking bangs needed significant trimming. The stylist said would need take couple inches length due damage. I said fine. I ask style changes. I somehow walked bangs take front part head, much like small child's haircut (to serve purpose keeping hair child's face). He also took almost five inches length, instead "couple" promised. I feel like haircut looks like cross bowl cut, female mullet, futuristic look Mia Wallace Pulp Fiction. I'm pretty open minded different haircuts, one truly awful, it's short even pull back easily try make look better. I'm going place Shadyside today see maybe extensions remedy mullet look, implement kind cut make look little better. It's shame, place downtown convenient workplace, I certainly risk again. :(
I started going I grad school CMU. Since graduating 2010 I've returned visit friends least year, I ALWAYS make sure include hair appointment Denham & Co. Literally favorite hair salon I've ever to. The cuts always chic, never cookie-cutter boring, hair color always on-point. Love them, keep coming back whenever I can!
I curly hair staff struggled straighten I went do.
I'm one typically write reviews, I find everyone's experience biased one; however, Hilary deserves amazing shout-out. I hair stylist 10yrs moving city made drive inconvenient...I walked back February 2015, wonderful Hilary! I never disappointed (~7 appointments), I don't think I ever be. I transitioned brown grey August sisters wedding, late hair stylist attended said I found keeper. This past week I made appointment get hair done Thanksgiving, roots atrocious I sick roots general, I loved grey/silver/platinum look. Hilary toned hair perfection walking around town today I unable walk block without someone commenting hair. From bartender Primantis Strip, one employees Stans Market, butcher Wholeys, 3 people passing street. I say, one person knows make guy 4 cowlicks thickest hair ever look good, Hilary. Girl, I can't wait see comes Hair 2016! Thanks hair stylist! ~Lindley
I tired paying $50 cut I try style , looks like chopped mess If I could give review stars I would I told phone would $50 I went pay told $55 would budge. see later Denhams...... NOT!!!!
At 9:50 AM I walked in, ordered chicken biscuit. The girl register walked around second, came back said "we're out." So I asked time stop serving breakfast said 10:30 AM. She said girl who's cooking would "have make it." So I asked going happen. She walks three people standing around kitchen, asks cook she'll making more, cook looks me, makes rude face says no. The woman cook proceeded go back talking cooks leaning oven. At point I would've taken plain biscuit! It's disgusting people jobs go work stand around get paid nothing. I mean, tell customer 45 minutes breakfast ends you're "just going make biscuits." A complete lack work ethic, it's disgusting. I looked girl said, you're going make then? Laughed, walked out. My advice? Hire someone would grateful job would take pride it. Those people exist. You don't people kitchen act like that.
Rotten food charging customer. I expecting least reasonable dinning experience reputed restaurant, greatly disappointed. The restaurant charged 20% premium prices online menu (I ordered takeout), denied prices online. The maitre D reluctant show printed menu, 10% expensive online, led think charge deliberate. The crab cake sandwich well prepared ROTTEN crab. Since I didn't time walk 10min one way return food, thrown away. A lunch charged wasted.
Had mid-week lunch recently client request. I'm going break 2 areas I 2 different experiences: service food quality. Service: A++ Not I seated immediately I waited guest, upon learning I business lunch hostess sat quieter corner away bustling main room. I never wait staff say "thank you" "you're welcome" this. They even joked I ended waiting 30 minutes delayed guest. (I used time read Yelp reviews meal selection.) I hope service like times. For money doesn't get better here. Food: C Unfortunately food wasn't good service. I got chicken parmesan reading salads less overwhelming. I guess would OK like chicken parm buried veggies cheese. Me? I like chicken parmesan mostly, know, chicken. It wasn't bad, mind you, I make better dish home I certainly Italian restaurant. Can't say I recommend meal I day. (on hand, I lasagna I remember tasty). Quite frankly, Olive Garden better Italian experience, even chain restaurant failings. I forgive bad service food great (the tip interesting invention) way around. My search go-to Italian restaurant continue, though I can't say I won't back I get another invitation.
They must get patrons could reviews Tambellini restaurant close theater district. The food pretty bad Italian restaurant. The Chicken Parmigiana bready I question homemade. I ordered side salad iceberg lettuce. The homemade bread sorry..... Not worth price. The decor plain. Service fine.
It's good. We initially told waitress going order appetizers desert. My code "we read Yelp place sucks, wanted give try" replied don't alow I let slide. The food could come buffet better. I hate super negative, case I real.
This place flat joke. Totally overpriced. Went show gave limited menu tacked token 20% "service" fee gave right provide lousy service. First I asked beer chalkboard outside. Had NO clue I talking about. Finally gave got Coors Lite. Food overpriced less average. I Baked Scrod. Exact dish Eat N Park $8.99 better $27 dish. I would stay clear costs. If going night theater - opt eating outside city Sonoma Grill street. I'm shocked place still business.
Very mediocre. The food good worth price tag. I would expected much better service since two tables restaurant eating. I've worse experiences much better options area.
My friend I trying think place go last night dinner Mannheim Steamroller suggested Tambellini's. I hadn't million years thrilled downtown restaurant scene I agreed. It started seated lack luster hostess. You could tell either didn't want work yesterday really hated job. She zero personality. Then look menu. How much think charge simple bow tie pasta meat sauce? You're probably thinking $10 $12, right? WRONG! $20!! I happy ridiculous pricing, friend I felt already sitting felt funny leaving unfortunately stayed. Now I really wish would have. I figured I going spend $20 simple pasta I'll spend $10 steak it. I'm extremely strict diet 1200 calories day I could bow ties alfredo. All I asked replace alfredo simple marinara. You would think I asked get Giada DeLaurentis come cook pasta. The waitress gave attitude punished us rest time ignoring us. After I get meal, steak good (even though clearly well done, pieces practically still mooing) pasta tasteless. I would furious I paid $20 tasteless pasta. Never I go there. That place worst I recommend guys don't waste time importantly money either. The staff needs attitude adjustment, prices need reasonable given global economic collapse need work creating flavorful dishes. The reason I gave 2 steak good. Otherwise, would .5 1.
The good thing eatery proximity Benedum. The three us seated table jammed two tables, next kitchen - even though place half empty. I could hear conversation next door table better people sitting opposite me. The food sorry, sloppy, soggy mess would Chef Ramsey throw up. The service slow, inattentive, made feel vaguely unwelcome. Ridiculously overpriced. For better value, nicer atmosphere, quality food, I strongly recommend couple places nearby beat Tambellini's hands - McDonalds SubWay.
Since closed. Surprise surprise.
I think impression Sognatore started even I walked door. When I first called salon make appointment, woman bent backwards get schedule fit anywhere possible. We scheduled following week, immediately called back schedule following day. The negative thing I say place parking lot SUPER confusing. I went wrong side road, went lease parking, back finally park. That said, won't detract opinion. I've going various salons Pittsburgh area, never found one I've fallen love now. Laurie WONDERS hair! I told concerns even went cut bangs hair, first time since I child... She knocked park! I recommend salon anyone, really take care here!
The food quality doesn't match place all. I think it's ok pub place supposed nice place professional lunches. I chicken flatbread chicken like subway chicken! With many options around area I won't pick place lunch.
ZERO Stars. Today, friend wheelchair came friends wanted sit bar slice. They asked exception rule bar. The manager told friend could accommodated. That's illegal immoral absolutely disgusting.
Done place... It seems every time go get slower slower. Today waited 50 minutes cheese pizza never got walking out. I complain guy making pizzas says "you're one's here".... Well, secured fact I never back again.
This great little stop Smithfield Street. Frankie bartender major plus food across board plus. They offer wide range pasta dishes, hoagies, pizza. I recommend pizza. Though tried dozen dishes complaint. I usually get slice pizza today I added side meatballs. I want add won't paying fortune place. The service get bogged lunch staff get out. Try go hungry! I bet won't spend $10. Bring friends split pie. ;)
Jekyll Hyde Lunch counter front: product good service people skills horrible. A bit pricy too. All unacceptable area much competition lunch dollar Drinks bar back: it's lacking craft beers, service friendly atmosphere makes it. I'm enjoying Small Adams taking in. Hard believe establishment runs lunch crew.
Well others noted, customer service bit dicey. I ordered steak cheese hoagie arrived burnt bun. The portion size large however uses type generic wafer thin steak. It tasted OK. Nothing rave 11 bucks flat Coke mediocre steak cheese I really can't recommend place. I may try pizza reviews noted pricy. On side note, staff could spend less time talking hockey, politics, general bull jive look customers. No refills, checks food, nothing. Had I flagged waitress card I would waited pay well.
I started getting bitten nails done here. nail lady, Carol, fantastic job. Started tips I nails. I shocked nails get destroyed tips, happened anywhere else I gone. There one nail person, come there, I never problem getting appointments. She even stayed late occasion get in.
Definitely recommend salon! I booked appointment many failed attempts stylist able work biracial hair. I frustrated tired look unruly mop. I thick, frizzy, curly hair cannot tamed easily. The stylist ended hair Chris fantastic! She listened I wanted, fun talk to, gave many helpful tips. I walked salon feeling satisfied new look. Anyone biracial hair children make appointment her, let down!
I've going salon 10 years. While I going Salon Nuvo I long, thick, wavy hair short bangs. My whole life I've issues finding right stylist I ridiculous amount hair. I found Autumn reviews people curly hair right..Autumn seriously gifted cutting curly/thick hair. In time I went Autumn I got constant compliments hair. My long, control hair finally control. I didn't even blow dry cuts gave me, managed work natural hair type make lay perfectly. I can't say enough awesome is. Unfortunately really difficult get Downtown negative thing salon..I switch salon near house matter much I pay noone even compare Autumn. Hopefully reading review people get experience Autumn's awesomeness since I can't anymore :(.
I went Brazilian blowout . After spending around 400 bucks including tip hair changed . They look even worse . They re-did try fix nothing happened. I complains stylist. She nice looking details procedure product work . When I showed results second time wash juts said thanks stopping by. I wasted money :(
The salon dirty left I let cut hair. The sanitizers old half full. The scissors combs mess. http://www.wellbuzz.com/dr-oz-beauty/dr-oz-pedicure-bacterial-infections-dry-pedicure-haircut-ringworm/
I thick, curly hair, Autumn always great job cutting hair, even squirming toddler lap.
Horrible service food comparable Ruth Chris I I've 10-15 different cities. My rib-eye fat waitress snotty wanted throw drinks her. Save money, place doesn't deserve named Ruth Chris. I've better steaks Outback Steakhouse!!
I'm really torn review. For years years favorite restarant downtown area. We went last Saturday dinner I would deem average meal exorbitant prices. The salads, tasty, much smaller I remembered previously. The side dishes, again, seemingly smaller party well. Unfortunately, worst part meal steaks. For $45 I received New York Strip WAY overpriced (my wife makes time much much better) was, word, chewy. The service overall, quite good, unless like car valet (they don't it). Next time I'll try Morton's Capital Grille.
Can't go wrong 50 dollar prime beef every often. This place treat... expensive treat. No complaints food service. If considering restaurant know expect top quality around. Side note... I think steaks little bit better Texas Roadhouse could buy three steaks price one RC. Just sayin'.
Apparently I wasn't important enough lunch burger order (even though $16.95...) server come back see cooked medium, certainly NOT. When I FINALLY got chance ask it, acted indignant I would question checked pad, yes, I ordered medium. Then stared me. Stared. I say, I never felt smaller restaurant experience life. Extremely disappointing appalling. Will give business Capital Grille on. I urge same.
I eaten lot Ruth's Chris joints. This place nothing tasted like them. Apparently part main chain shows. Fail levels. Had send steak back twice I said hell it. Horrible.
Oldies dying fast burgh. In order keep times, classics don't pass high end classy place go anymore. I ordered special sea bass. My cousin ordered portion easily double mine. Plus worst presentation ever!!!!!! How send piece fish steak plate. I get whole family style small mini plate fish depressing. Think it... If restaurant ultimate goal. Have customer remember meal, right? Well someone serves tiny portion fish $38... There nothing worth remembering lonely fish plate. Oh yeah I eat asparagus side plate. The asparagus twice size plate. Really.... The wife steak. The plate 100 degrees oil bubbling plate. They clearly used much oil let meat rest. Cause done plate grosssssss oily bloody mess. The severs need basic training. Serve left clear right!!!! Basics.... Come on. I expect things high end place. Never going back!
Poor, slow service. Steak cooked plate hot "sizzling". We greeted less 3 servers said working "as team". After that, receive visit anybody 20 minutes. Finally, one three arrived immediately "take order". Our salads seemingly immediately delivered. Before finished salads fourth server asked ready main course. I said no, yet probably mistake. I doubt steaks sat heat lamp. Our wine delivered steaks arrived. Yes, might seem like trivial critique meal nearly $100/person it's legitimate. We Ruth's Chris country experiences vary wildly trended downward. This experience "final straw". We never return Ruth's Chris Steakhouse.
Short story: guy smeared sole rubber shaft boots, said didn't it, tried clean took leather's dye instead, didn't give refund (I'd already paid). Moral story: risk dude, pay end check damages. Long story below. Oh, Groupon, you've steered wrong yet again. I awful luck service places I've used Groupons overall...hey, put Groupon bring customers, pissed said customers show discounts! basically, I think cobbler screwed making $5 $40 worth services. I dropped two pairs leather riding boots get new heels. I called given quote $20 pair told still day service. I'd bad feeling place I called quote guy I talked didn't know riding boots looked like...He thought spiked heel...but I magical Groupon use, I went anyway. So, I went. After haggling (and seeing I Groupon), cobbler told soles "bald tires" replace well. So we're $40 pair. I said fine I love boots quite expensive. I told come back 2pm. Three hours later, I return. The cobbler finishes one boot immediately hands look at. I'm pleased say so. I pay. I'd brought canvas tote I start packing boots done one one. And I see appearing remaining three boots...the brownish-black rubber soles fingerprinted boot's shaft. Oh, hell no. Here's play-by-play: Me: Uhhhh, I don't think boots before. [points blobs] Front Counter Lady: I don't know, don't understand process. It's possible happen. Cobbler: [Not even looking] Nope, I didn't that. That must there. Looks like hair stuff. Me: [WHAT] Um, I'm pretty positive wasn't there. [Get phone photo I took boots dropping off.] C: Nope, wasn't me, let see I get off. FCL: [begins rant people never pleased, etc.] Me: If look shaft hits sole, see smears splatters right there. So, like this. C: What expect day service? Me: [now fuming] For damage boots I'm paying repair. FLC C: [Talking other. Alternatively making excuses one else offers day blaming somehow shoddy work.] [C grabs another boot clean I see whatever he's using making worse taking dye.] Me: Just please give back. I already paid I don't want clean anymore. C: You really buy de-salting waterproofing treatment you're going wear snow. Me: I don't wear snow. Please give boot I leave. C: Okay, baby. Have nice day, baby. Don't advertise "While-U-Wait" you're going gripe terrible job. What would made happy, ask? If cobbler admitted maybe made mistake, voided $40 dollar charge (the $40 Groupon), offered clean properly free. I would even agreed run $40 charge AFTER he'd restored boot shafts. But, instead, total jerk. Additionally, woman "working" counter clue prices random friends using chairs customers times I there. And times, ignored good two minutes screeching, "You need something?" Rude. FYI, previously mom I repairs Ullrich's back older Calabrese gent working old location. The repairs 75% cheaper service excellent. Honestly, I think family started going Italian owner (I'm quarter Calabrese myself), I won't ever go back. Results: After applying leather cleaning solution using leather shoe brush/eraser, marks rest appear permanent. This 4 hours scrubbing. Ugh. Pictures posted damage viewing pleasure.
This place horrible. The cobblers know they're doing. You get better service elsewhere cheaper. I came place get dress shoes tapped rubber protection pads applied front half. There logos bottom shoes I told cobbler cover logos. The cobbler kept saying knew exactly doing. In end, I found ground half logo one shoes covered rubber protection. Also, smeared black glue (used apply rubber protection pads) bottom shoes.
Best deal shoe repair! I've trying get boots resoled didn't pay $50+ bucks charge everywhere else. I stumbled happily fixed day mere $12. I mean painfully awkward attempt small talk ..."so family Japan?" "you go gym lot?"... I'll bear much $12 fix
55 cent surcharge use debit card -_- ... 24 hours convenient point park univ. I came alot whenever I student dining hall closed.
While Pittsburgh, decided try Papa J's. I still sure did. Anyway, food decent. Not great, tasty. Our server friendly. It little weird ones there. I Pittsburgh, I sure night what. All left satisfied.
It's odd place -- former brothel that's reputed haunted, lot dark polished wood decor. In times I've there, it's never crowded. It's noirish, even daytime; sort place you'd go watch horse races -- desperately, course, you'd bet all. And guy end bar hasn't home years, ominous bartender Dark Secret, you'd better keep damn beak it! Except bartenders actually quite warm, ominous all. In fact, they're willing learn preferred arcane beverage recipes. One guy there, Frank, actually keeps little book new recipes learns customers, I appreciated quite bit. I also really enjoy appetizers here, especially flatbreads bruschetta, probably least noirish foods imaginable. So, ignore instincts spooky-seeming place check out. The entrees terribly impressive, it's great stop evening plans it.
Based AWFUL service I received last three times I dined I never, ever come back restaurant--and real shame bc I really wanted like place. Strike 1 (and biggest offense) Light Up Night - I called reservations hung told didn't need them. My party 4 arrived 5ish expecting packed restaurant place EMPTY. We asked table told due amount reservations going hour. I get that--but place EMPTY. The host NOT gracious this, instead seemed frazzled bothered there. We sat super cool looking bar ordered drinks asked could order appetizers bar. The bartender, complete dick, said, "I full house tonight, I'm going take food orders bar." I'd like mention guy apparently bar tender Papa J's Carnegie--not regular bartender awesome. The place EMPTY. We order drinks. And wait, wait, wait. All see empty tables I kept thinking...you know...if sat us would now! So I asked bartender helping host... "Why can't seat us since place empty, HOUR want know think might get seated." We would left honestly invested time point. The bartender said, "Well, people could take time make reservation, hold table them." Well...yikes. If act wonder restaurant dead every single time there. When finally sat, seated tiny table wedged room huge party three sets parents like, 36 screaming children. It nightmare. Turns regular bartender waiting tables night felt bad wait got seated took one entrees bill. So cool, enough make moron coworker. Strike 2 - If go lunch order hamburger, expect waitress give attitude ask cheese. "Yeah, didn't know italian restaurant mozzerella." Really? I didn't know hamburgers traditional Italian fare. I wouldn't upset hamburger--which burnt, flavorless, tasted like freezer burn along diet coke came $14.00. For burger. coke. The prices ridiculous. Strike 3- Empty restaurant. I mean, EMPTY. My friend bread wiith meals. Our thing olive oil empty, full thing olive oil table next ours. NO ONE ELSE dining room. I took olive oil table next ours. Our waitress came like, "Ma'am, free all, can't take things tables need something ask." WTF! There one olive oil... also attentive, I wouldn't needed take olive oil. She would brought us full one. So, I've tried place 5 times enough. I dont know remains open I suspect close soon. Not worth attitude staff. They dont seem appreciate customers shame, bc I like restaurant I recommend I bring friends there.
I'm quite sure happened Papa J's past year.... I remember always delighted lunches past. When coworker suggested last week, I really excited go back. As soon sat down, everyone noticed dead fruit flies table. Yuck. Our waiter friendly attentive. He mess one order though, decided eat mistakenly gave her. I Chicken Piccata. I love dish. My boyfriend's version pretty top notch, Papa J's high standards live to. It meh. The chicken wasn't well seasoned sauce overpowered lemon. All I could taste citrus. I also bites Chicken Marsala. Not sure ingredients used sauce, holy crap sweet. Really glad I didn't order dish, I wouldn't able eat it! I really disappointed visit. We probably won't back time soon.
The Post-Gazette reported 12/7/13 restaurant closed.
I can't find complaint place. Drinks reasonable. Only ever seems $1 cover. Couches lounging. Pool table. Room dancing want (no one hardly seems to). Staff super friendly. During Pride place stop get drink cheaper beer tents outside.
For place called Mon Amiee, un-friendliest place I've ever shopped. The elderly couple oversee premises make feel you're commit chocolate faux pas moment. Come on, smile would help. The selection stellar, prices ridiculously high. You get stuff World Market $2 less bar. Even Whole Foods less expensive. Nice gellato. Good Chocolates. Expensive. Grim staff.
I review nonpareils truffle sampler. The nonpareils low quality dark chocolate 14.00 per pound definitely worth it. The truffles two salted, one milk chocolate. They salty chocolate flavor come through. I assume chocolate name brand wrappers better ones make house.
I stopped Mon Aimee carry chocolate hazelnut wafer (hanuta) friends enjoy. I decided take quick snap chat video varieties show towners missing on. As soon I opened app woman (very rudely) stopped insisted I put phone away leave. I understand don't want one copy style. However Pittsburgh about. There room 'snobs' like city. This experience. I heard others say friendly unfortunate Pittsburgh welcoming. Grandpa Joe's Sinful Sweets great alternatives.
Very rude staff, follow around like secret service watching every move make. Please help carry candy bar register. And top it, $10.00 minimum credit debit cards, AT A CANDY STORE?! No thanks, much better candy shops around city.
Bagels! I prefer Einstein guys (you know I'm talking about!). Their fare locations, sets one apart staff. They extremely nice accommodating always little chit chat food prepared. If mood bagels head over!
There's nothing specific location bad. It's Einstein Bagels food itself. I got Santa Fe Egg wrap, I don't understand use term "egg" name. There's way hell slimy yellow gelatin came chicken! Absolutely horrible.
This produce stand wonderful resource you're looking eat healthy tight budget. A quantity produce would cost $40-$50 Giant Eagle another supermarket probably set back less $20 here. Recently I bought: 5 pounds apples $2, bags baby spinach $1, entire flat mangoes $8, red bell peppers $2/pound... it's like prehistoric prices stuff. The selection decent: pretty much always find type vegetable you're looking for. There 2 things hold Stan's away five-star rating. One market really well-heated winter, freeze aren't warmly dressed. The careful assessment buy. That $1 head cauliflower, $1 quart strawberries, priced low reason, typically half cauliflowers baskets strawberries gone bad. At Stan's, don't like old-ladyish careful minute inspection produce you're buy, probably come regret it.
A good old-fashioned produce market like used back home: rough floor (in case old macadam), crude wooden tables, nothing else pallets bins fruits vegetables. The prices quite low; I don't know compare local groceries cheap hell compared Chicago prices. One complaint: Much wares displayed pre-packaged styrafoam trays covered plastic. Not wasteful (I hate extraneous packaging) removes freedom choice buyer's hands. I may want ONE item, two three six, I'm picky, I want find PERFECT one. Neither option much produce I saw past Sunday.
Cheap, everyone seems say that. And it's true. But I wasn't feeling here. I one want dig dirty find golden product. I know it's strip, I didn't appreciate amount bugs flying around I browsing produce. This probably place I walk next time I'm strip. I enjoy all.
Cheap! doesn't necessarily mean bad - least Stan's Market. However, definitely check, double check triple check occasions buy anything. We stop twice month groceries - mostly less likely perishable produce like garlic, ginger, peppers, baby cucumbers. However, usually end buying lot since cook daily basis. If happen buy soft fruits like strawberries, blue berries grapes - likely need finish day two. If not, always freeze make smoothies. Let say again, place cheap. The prices I pay produce usually 1/3 price I pay Giant Eagle. So, know produce - definitely place stop.
"Could bought store" Hershey ice cream crystal-y signs freezer burn. Totally disinterested staff included girl texting walked shouting cell phone walked out. No one gave us bill I interrupt person cash register get take money. Didn't even get "thanks" change. So worth walk took get here.
Solid ice cream. When see place ice cream/toppings, get nervous quality poor (syrup comes big container, put random candies toppings, something you'd see average ice cream shop). Turns ingredients lot better appear.
This place terrible!!!! I went first time National Ice Cream Day 2015 thought, give try. Ugh. The entire place needs gutted renovated. There's much dead space, missed opportunity crowds: chaos disorganization. Skip it!!!
Giving place 2 stars I like ice cream last experience I really want give 1. On Wednesday, I called around 6:30 pm asked late would open. I told 9:00 pm. I went 8:15 pm closed! Why would give closing time close much earlier? I called next day ask happened. I could understand emergency came up, nope! I told customers two hours decided close early. I'm sorry didn't customers day can't close whenever feel like it, least adjust timings tell people hours accordingly. TL;DR: I drove 25 minutes directions see closed sign door even I called confirm hours, disappointing.

Really disappointed! I several times since place got new owners every time unpleasant. My 3yo I waited ten minutes table ignored anyone come take order. Three separate parties came us two guys served slowest fashion. Finally I got said help you? I got son wee cone $2.94. Yes, wee cone overpriced. Then I asked sundae didn't ice cream I wanted, second choice, third. I said, "forget it." I told son place isn't won't back. Hopefully train employees friendly, prompt, goof around.
Sat watched several customers walk "employee" ate ice cream behind bar didn't say word bother acknowledge them. She left co-worker handle entire crowd. We experience walked in. When finally find strength help, returned serving without washing hands. Very sad, seems place amazing history potential. However I agree previous reviews staff killing it. Will return.
I grew klavon grandkids. We used come every night softball games. I haven't long time, I walked I extremely surprised. The menu changed (trying like Starbucks instead ice cream parlor/old time pharmacy penny candy was), people working rude place FILTHY. I won't ever return. They give "Klavons" horrible name. I feel bad family sold business turned this.
It's weird leave blood lab excited, right? Well, that's happened. Pregos like get variety tests throughout three trimesters. Not sure anyone LIKES blood taken, I definitely hate it. However, I pleasantly surprised discover Quest location downtown. Not location convenient, atmosphere is, dare I say it, welcoming? In addition, phlebotomist Mary sweet Mary Sunshine. She thorough explaining would happen, found traditionally hard-to-find veins little trouble. I 20 minutes. I practically bleeding joy. If get bloodwork, try Quest, Downtown. It's [nearly] painless.
Came back year later, it's review again... except guy bad hair. He looks like he's made manager something... weird.
I'd give ZERO stars could. Worst customer service! My husband made innocent mistake confused weekends trip back home town. We asked get credit offered add night stay. The hotel would NO money. But corporate suits refused. So - they've lost customer - PLATINUM customer. We've given Marriott much bloody money years, greedy suits could care less. A little goodwill would cost nothing. Where good customer service gone????? Truly pathetic. And believe - theres nothing special abt hotel. The William Penn, Doubletree, several hotels FAR FAR FAR superior. Get good rates Priceline. Heck - i'll even give shout Renaissance downtown -- it's owned Courtyard jerks. Good luck! Go Steelers!
When I checked in, front desk staff missing. When I checked out, front desk staff missing. The valets chased every single time I needed park retrieve car. When I called week later regarding charges account, first call disconnected. On second call, I put hold ten minutes I gave up. On THIRD call, I asked clerk email copy form, informed scanner would unable several days. The pillows appalling complimentary breakfast refrigerator. Does ANYBODY run show here?? What disgrace Marriott name.
Ok, go way help! I didn't credit card first said I couldn't check in. Finally allowed put cash. Then I went breakfast, shuttle refused pick us "roads bad" We waited 45 minutes restaurant. No cabs could pick us up, I called hotel explained situation (had get work soon, 5 mth pregnant woman me, mile half away). He said couldn't help. We walk snow blew faces. When almost there, saw shuttle pull smoking shuttle driver it, driving opposite direction, away us. I cannot believe rude
Literally worst service i've ever received hotel. Was using conference room multiple days beg snooty staff come refill waters clean room. Also, policies like much parking costs seem change visit visit. To sum up, cringe thinking i'll ever speak people front desk again. The location amazing, going them. Do stay here. You disappointed.
This hotel well located. However staff, especially Zac don't care bit elite status not. The staff young. The manager nowhere seen. No upgrades. Room high ceiling. So what. Not personal strictly business. Restaurant great shakes. One three. The better restaurant little cafe across street owned owner. Bellhop seen limited times. To get cab walk Westin across street. Or take bus. No hello entering. Not friendly. So stay here? Not 4 star. Really 3 star. Point redemption way high. Nothing recommend. Stay Westin across street kiss staff goodbye. Run. Don't walk away. Not even shuttle goes anywhere useful. Linda b august 2013 never stay again!
Just checked work. The location decent, accommodations great. I reserved king room got stuck room two queens. Normally issue, coworker checks time gets upgraded, nothing done person, well puts bad taste mouth. Stay Pittsburgh Marriott City Center instead. I staying location again. Also cannot say I impressed person checked either.
Nice staff, I stepped giant wet spot room, causing pair socks get soaked. The floor stained ton black spots making look dirty. There's way I'm walking barefoot here, I don't socks wear, I walk around shoes. They apologized I appreciate, doesn't fix anything. I can't wait check out.
It's terrible thing work next New York style deli... terrible. Oh shoot... I forgot lunch today. Guess I'll go grab sandwich... You really cannot go wrong Smallman Street Deli. Though around noon gets pretty packed, call order ahead avoid line. Whether desire Rueben, burger, homemade soup, you'll leave thinking NYC. The princing tad high end deli, everything cooked order fresh. There seats available - outdoor seating warmer months too. If you're Strip want sandwich, stop Smallman Street Deli.
Yuck I avoided Subway like plague. It's bad location conveniently way job. I literally walk past Subway 5 times week. Even 1:15pm it's never packed lunch reason sandwiches stink. When I say gross I mean standards food low standards cleaning. The attitude workers pitiful. The don't care making good sandwich care keeping place clean. What wreck. As one eats Subway 3 times week I feel entitled opinion, avoid subway.
THE place catch touring Broadway shows
saw austrailian pink floyd show 2 times doo wop show once. place built everyone 5'5 150 lbs. 6'3 270 lbs ,so toyt squeese 2 hour concert. sound atmosphere makes forget knees loc ated behind ears. red carpet walls makes get giddy. betcha cat would go ape place like this. hope open forever.
I love here! It like walking little piece history, I could see upper crusts socializing back day. Furs fedoras, long cigarette holders gracing hallways. This gorgeous theater hard capture pictures lighting glares. I experienced large playhouses cities. But advice pick show love decent Broadway one, splurge year make experience much memorable. Spend little extra refreshments yes expensive experience. I don't think upper seats bad yelp seem to, afford still nice view. And unlike Heinz hall little leg room. There always audience members behaving naughty complaint. The ushers helpful let minutes late (Grrr Pittsburgh parking), speaking parking I would park 9th Penn garage one liberty ninth can. I appreciate theater history modern contributions, I think individuals understand kind history American cities left decay. Cue Detroit, sadly. So props cultural trust whomever keeping one going.... true Pittsburgh beauty,
Incredibly slow, worst club I've ever had...hilite tortilla soup. That actually edible. Waiting 40 minutes cold club cup soup totally unacceptable. Especially 2nd table seated day.
I treated younger sister kid brother dinner , recognize high PSSA scores academic success far school year. What I say kids love place. For food terrible. I wouldn't even cooked way enemy. I got cabo shrimp salad. This four tiny dried shrimp served bowl ice berg lettuce rotten tomatoes. The kiddies Beatlejuices grape juice Sprit gummy worms. They also Oreo milk shakes demolished said super yummy. Each dinner also cheese burger. The burger juicy delicious. I comment th bathrooms. They terrible shape. The toilet paper rolls broken instead fixing toilet paper rolls Max Erma's sit roll toilet paper top broken toilet roll. I couldn't believe it!
I previously reviewed Golden Palace buffet, stating worst Chinese food I've had. Well, place manages worse it. The place rather run down. The buffet really terrible. Food left sit oil barely lit heat source. It wasn't great environment. Try something else, definitely!
1.5 stars. I agree Eszter, deserves 2 stars service. A sad little "Chinese" buffet smattering overcooked options. Soups borderline offensive. There probably won't wait!
I can't tell bad place is, regretted looking yelp reviews ordering delivery. Seriously place worst Chinese food I've whole life!!!!!!!!!!
Bad!!! Worst Chinese food Pittsburgh!
This worst Chinese food I've had. Ever. And Pittsburgh pretty bad Chinese places. The Golden Palace buffet bad, least edible. I utterly baffled place stays business.
food s**t one inside except cook/owner waitress, late night near closing, thing could find open. I don't like chinese food begin cept rice, chicken beef teriaki ok, order rice butter gravy it, luck, plain rice think ok deal that, WRONG! f**k plain rice!? along rice found bits boiled eggs, onions, bits red & green peppers, corn, bits meat couldn't recognize something else, tasted awful! took 10 bites total till seen various bits bottom got whiff egg made gag! spit last bite downing water took hotel room, left note "free chinese food eat me" one touched I found later trash can.. Those ate think food even "ok" sense smell tastebuds, stoned eat anything 0 stars food taste quality. give credit willing serve late staff went home, wait wasn't long 10-15 mins
Dined in. Food obviously sitting day buffet. Lo Mien soggy unidentified black grit it. Broccoli clearly unwashed whenever cooked. Finally I ordered beef broccoli meat looked pale like chicken tasted gamey chicken beef. First time I ever wondered I served cat.
Disagree previous post. Went 1902 tavern lunch weeks back. To start waiter appeared either crack speed. Second I party 4 ordered salads. I decided go steak. Awful call part. The salad took 45 minutes arrive, along cracked waiter (who hadn't seen least 30 minutes) The steak total bullshit. Overcooked cold. The salad way much iceberg lettuce tasted like crap. I won't back Pittsburgh decides clean Market square vargrants inhabit area. Where people come from? nothing better except sit around market square, smoke cigarettes throw trash everywhere city workers clean filthy asses? My advice son, father, father did...get job!!!
Stopped quick drink new years eve 3 pm . The place empty . The bartender Chris rude vulger . He made crude sexual comment soon sat . We decided stay drink anyway . After going couple choices told bar stock . On New Years Eve ??? The Bartender kept complaining job bosses next 10 minutes . We paid drinks got left . Might strangest employee experience I awhile .
You want it? They got it! And some. Whether want Steelers Pirates Penguins....it's here. Having birthday party, anniversary party, wedding baby shower? It's here. Parrothead, pirate, cowboy party? Yep. It's here. If FIND mardi gras event, get yer beads here. Everything everyone. It's here. A party party Pittsburgh store!
I freakin' love place. Anything could possibly want, they've got it. And probably lot stuff don't want. I loved everyone listed crazy things they've seen - much more. 2 gems friend got there: giant bottle sriracha sauce & fake tattoo sleeve. Ha!! All I got postcard, place I found Strip District sold them. Will definitely back, remember leave plenty room suitcase next time!
I've fish sandwiches Pittsburgh, it's staple burgh diet one dishes best. Sadly Wiener World worst. A bad fish sandwich Pittsburgh like bad BBQ Texas bad cheesesteak Philadelphia, offensive abomination denigrates pride reputation region. I never worse fish sandwich anywhere (including fast food hole walls) $10, assault taste buds doesn't come cheap. It bad every way could bad. Frozen, greasy, tasteless, heavy bland batter light fish. To add it, even though inside establishment large, chairs sit (just counters), don't take cards (cash only, atm) inside freezing, I shivering 60* temperature even though 80 outside July. So get 2 stars instead 1? My server nice, fries sandwich prepared fresh good, I've heard many reputable sources ice cream fantastic. That said, I'll licking wounds disappointment I lick ice cream.
It took two hours lunch wasn't even busy. When food finally came bad. We never received apology. The prices cheap, it's worth it.
A co-workers I decided try place yesterday. It sort early Christmas lunch among us I would working off-site next week. This typical bar extensive bar-type food menu. I opted soup-and-half-a-sandwich combo. The french onion soup I okay, little salty. My 1/2 sandwich, "Raechal" (similar Rueben, topped colselaw) corned beef decent.
The food terrible! I got crab cakes mostly bread crumbs. Two people table got crab bisque neither could take 2 spoonfuls. It Wednesday 7:30 restaurant completely empty besides group. We quickly found why. I would NOT recommend place food.
This small Irish pub. The set relatively nice, despite small size. However, location poor beer selection visited appeared least 3 draft selections. For well drinks, girlfriend typically drinks vodka cranberry noted pour weak vodka.
Nice weather returned 'Burgh I thought I'd get little bit lunch. Hey, gets little boring eating lunch desk time. Mahoney's typical bar fare though. The prices aren't bad, it's typical salad sandwich menu. I opted 1/2 corned beef French Onion soup. Good way spend lunch hour office.
Mahoney's type place women accosted bartender girlfriend evening. Don't go!
I digging set bar stools arm rests fine chair swiveled didn't awkward get person next get up. The bar area felt cramped made uncomfortable. There apparently small collection dictionaries thesauri keep register serious need dusty. I won't back soon.
Not vegetarians I stopped cocktail anyway sleepy, cold winter Monday night. Less 6 bucks top shelf cocktail. Interesting decor. Casual, neighbourhood-y bar.
Terrible. The food brought us didn't match menu. They brought different wine ordered didn't tell us ask. They messed bill. They didn't accommodate member group allergy. The beer skanked. The soda flat. Possible worst restaurant I ever in.
Worst experience restaurant ever. I don't need anything fancy pathetic. My coke colored water, I sent back said changed it. Came back said don't coke, would like sprite. The sprite flat I afraid order water that. Why didn't leave then. The menu quite spelling errors joked joke - don't go here. If I could rate zero, I would.
Worst restaurant ever. Only place openings Saturday night. Waited 25 minutes seated multiple tables open workers walking past us acknowledging presence. Finally got seated waited 20 minutes waters ate mediocre food. Won't back.
bad bad bad I town colts steelers October 2014. got steak fresh cut fries. steak rough bad. love French fires. fries joke. thin small. say love French fries disappointed says un filling. never back. live small town ohio. better food own. disliked meal bad could make better food home bathrooms health department violation
Let start saying I NOT coffee drinker, I can't tell coffees coffee terms apart beans (no pun intended). Needless say, leaving place, I felt like dumbest person alive frightened ever enter another legit coffee shop. I walked Fortunes couple friends looked menu dumbfounded I idea I reading. All I knew I drunk "macchiato" enjoyed it. So I thought, "What heck, I'll order caramel macchiato." This conversation went barista: Me: Hi, I'd like medium caramel macchiato. Barista: So, want order OUR macchiato? Me: Uhh...sure...? Two minutes later I get tiny cup meager amount liquid it. I turn around look friends confusedly, wondering I went wrong. The barista notices gets attention: Barista: That's I asked whether wanted OUR macchiato. Me: Oh...ok... The barista, clearly frustrated, takes cup, pours makes caramel latte. Alright avid coffee drinkers, laugh want I idea difference Caffè macchiato (espresso macchiato) American replicate (Latte Macchiato???). I'm even sure I said correct. For drink I got, I can't complain price (Did I over- underpay actual price caramel latte?), especially given prices Starbucks days. Also, given fact I made stupid mistake means place must good coffee shop. Beyond that, unfortunately, I can't make judgment -- hence modest rating. Perhaps I start drinking coffee, I'll re-examine review re-rate it.
My wife I live downtown. Today hosting baby shower I time spare. I Wood Street Gallery many times before, I wanted review experience I today. The exhibits 2nd 3rd floors. They usually eclectic art encourage staying watching taking part. The current exhibits audio based hypnotic I wanted zone while. The exhibit 2nd floor based interaction water deep, droning base. The way speakers set water creates waves water reflected wall behind it. It's cool meditative. I highly recommend stop Wood Street time experience current exhibit ends December.
A disappointing Amtrak station. What's really sad passenger rail degraded far country, especially one areas rail king. Anyone walks outside Amtrak station witness Pittsburgh's Penn Station, proud magnificent facility outlines important passenger rail was, vast rotunda shelter vehicular traffic, majestic waiting area. Unfortunately, converted ... condos. Now, there's dumpy little room rows seating Amtrak desk. Given two Amtrak lines serve station, daily, that's probably sensible, sad commentary "progress" often isn't.
This review Amtrak's "Pennsylvanian" train, only, system whole. O' Amtrak's "Pennsylvanian" train. So much potential! The good: --Spectacular scenery Greensburg Harrisburg. The highpoint stretch Johnstown Altoona, especially Horseshoe Curve. --Relaxing ride putting traffic. --Generally friendly crews. The bad: --Lousy westbound schedule puts Pittsburgh 8pm--well past dinnertime. If need sustenance, eat 'meh" food lounge car--or bring own. If you're connecting westbound "Capitol" train, you're stuck four hour layover Amtrak's basement waiting room. --If you're heading eastbound, "Pennsylvanian" receives connecting passengers "Capitol". Guess what? If train's late, you're leaving late. Oddly enough, schedule worked favor time. Supervisor Susan three team members take one-day business trip Altoona. Our company car already spoken for, however train schedule allowed full business day. The question was, would train depart time? Hooray! It did! Believe me, lot time make jobsite Altoona.
This place horrible. Did not, even moment, seat chairs waited board next train. The walls dirty, nasty dingy. It smelled awful inside. It quite crowded. And I like surroundings. And dont let get started restroom. seeing filth here, decided walk street 5am freezing cold greyhound station nearby use facilities. There absolutely type cafe even little convenient store within station grab bite eat wait. I find vending machine get coffee even watered down. This place needs torn rebuilt bottom up. I waited family street different station back board train. I sure place future stops. Not good way sell city...Horrible! The reason give station 1 star train quite comfortable clean.
Small simple train station. No Red Caps help customers big downer. Traffic getting horrendous also.
Train delayed 4 hours update 30 minutes arrival. This continued total 4 hours. There Wifi two outlets. I decided take train speed comfort walking around journey. The cons outweighed pros. It would probably better take Mega Bus. The Washington DC train performance standard means constantly checked efficiency time. Right 30% :(. Not good all.
Not four-star cuisine, good Take Out. As tell I regular lunch goer Penn Avenue. The take food Fu Lai always dependable price reasonable. Because I prefer food little plain side, I always get chicken pea pods chicken vegetables. Very satisfying!
I've eating 10 years so, starting back art institute days. The place stayed stable years although food dropped little quality since staff changed. But still can't beat two entree lunch $4.92!
Unbelievably bad! If roach crawling wall doesn't scare away terrible fried rice will. The egg rolls cabbage them. The "chicken" dark, fatty, inedible. Don't miss 100 pound tub MSG walk in. I paid food ate half egg roll noticed roach, food delivered, I took one look threw out, left. You skip place sure.
It'd years since I've Fu Lai judging recent reviews, it's become hit miss. But I Penn Avenue last month I thought I'd stop lunch (and yeah, I'm procrastinating reviews here). I guess I "hit" day 'cos lunch pretty decent. I usually get chicken vegetables chicken peapods places like this. So I guess you've gotta stick basics eating here.
Did enjoy meal ever.The staff cold seating area dirty. The place hole wall I appreciate. Cheap getting pay quality.
If place downtown isn't busy lunch time either you're much wise hundreds thousands professionals OR place stinks. Fu Lai later. The food gross I usually wouldn't say place. My General Tso's seemed previously frozen I think I got 100% gristle. I don't shriek sight MSG, place uses bit much. I got whopping 2 pieces wilted broccoli 1 sliver onion dish sauce ewww sauce. Not sure I stepped Fu Lai, probably I wanted cheap Chinese. Never going back.
I've lived downtown 15 years go place Chinese. The food always hot,tasty can't beat price compared places downtown. I always get orange chicken shrimp fried rice appetizer part menu perfect small get togethers like game thrones night.
I tried give place chance despite it's reviews. It's worth it. They quick (food ordered delivered 25 minutes). The thing is, lo mein noodles way overcooked didn't one vegetable them. The noodles bland almost chewy. My boyfriend's general tso's less subpar. The egg roll's didn't even shrimp them. Next time, I'll listen reviews.
This far worst Chinese food I ever had. We ordered general gso extra spicy absolutely taste it. There wasnt even sauce! It horrible. The fried rice didn't vegetable bland. The egg roll wasnt even cooked cabbage awful. I called complain hung me. I would never recommend place anyone. Don't waste time, order somewhere else.
Worst Chinese I've Pittsburgh. I ordered pork fried rice.
The preparation fast price reasonable doesn't make fact everything bad, weird taste food inevitably made us sick afterwards. We ordered pick forgot drinks plastic ware. I definitely never order again. Absolutely disgusting.
The Chinese donuts amazing...... that's it. I General Tao's chicken w fried rice, chicken wasn't chicken.... I'll forever order donuts that's it!
Despite mixed reviews I wanted try this. I spend 40 dollars soggy food lacked flavor. This food made obligation, love.
Cheap food chicken burnt. My co-worker's chicken wasn't cooked right. Not gonna order again.
Some good, stuffed grape leaves,hummus baklava, beware, items shelf long. We discovered got home two expensive cheeses spoiled (no bree slimy & stinky mozzarella.) We wasted $12 spoiled food. Buyer beware. We town cant return them. :( staff seemed distant got impression want bothered. Stoic unsmiling older guy behind counter. Hum, I'll here... grouch.
I always keep forgetting Pittsburgh winter cold FREEZING cold! another awesome place strip...if trouble finding authentic Italian market store around Pittsburgh...look further! place real deal... owned actual Italians...I tired American stores think sell authentic food/goods Italy..this place all...everything fresh wide verity produce...you basically sample anything offer... need politely ask ;)
Sorry say I another problem, I purchased cheese weekend moldy. I noticed several cheeses looked like trimmed mold way cut....so I looked closely I got home opened I noticed cheese couple cracks green mold inside... And tasted old. This blue cheese!
Do use dry cleaner. The staff/owner smokes store. There ash trays packs cigarettes lying around. I "air out" clothes I picked Galardi's try get rid cigarette smell. YUK!
Ehh... it's that. Watch dried bulk stuff - it's old stale. I found little bugs crawling around seeds nuts little bags. Had throw away! Bought store's speciality sausages - bland tasted spoiled meat. Cold cuts good though pricey. Also cashier over-charge buy many bulk items, particularly olives. There good food finds, overall store impress me.
Ah, treasure trove! Five distinct rooms meats/cheeses, dry goods, bottled/jarred/canned products, bakery items, produce. Do favor: walk deli room, stop, close eyes, breathe deeply. That smell close heaven. I minutes later I noticed friend exact same. Bins barrels nuts, beans, pasta, etc; huge metal cans bulk olive oil; giant plastic buckets olives; dozen cheeses; several Italian-style deli meats several traditional American selections; spices half-gallon size little $1 2-oz cups; every sort bottled condiment, sauce, pickle, garnish, Italian-ish specialty food item think of; big racks baked goods; modest produce selection. This place everything! My heart leapt I saw gaperon cheese menu board. I've looking gaperon almost two years. Alas, didn't any...big fat sad face. The frozen pierogis I bought last night's dinner tasted fantastic. Their baked good section mostly bare 2pm Sunday, go early!
Have regular several years. They great selection cheeses, sauces pastas. They also small bread area produce section. Most reviews online positive I share negative. 1. Be careful pasta selections. You pay high price bowl noodles tear apart soon hit water. Know buying leave alone. I always felt people behind cheese counter knowledgeable. Anytime I cooking particular type food looking cheese would go good with........I ask. This past time I saw one regular employees informed making mexican food friends I looking cheese would make good queso.....but I unable finish. As soon I said work "mexican" glared told although I may think looks mexican - wasn't. He left standing counter went get drink water. Maybe bad day - didn't improve mine any. I bought cheese street. Not sure I go back, least I try get someone else wait me.
The restrooms looked like bombardment, improvised shack amid buckets olives spices. Highly questionable hygiene food store!Disgusting. I go back clean place. It's filthy!!!
Can't beat selection!!!!! There's nothing dislike place besides lack samples. Variety, freshness, quality two thumbs up!
The cheese counter "Dear Heart" really treasures. They manner fancy aged gruyeres, tons olives, even sort disgusting concoction called "pepperoni cheese". In case, place kinds old-world beautiful. Shelf shelf yummy goods, Italian imports...yum.
I Shopping, Penn.Mac, day customer front buying Almonds, asked Q. price Cashier responded Smart A--s. answer, The Same Cashier waited She Very Very Rude, gave mea Smart A--s. answer. first time. idea, Get rid Cashiers, Fire Them! go back gone. hope Owner read's this?
I grew Pittsburgh strip tons times (usually eat Primanti's). I idea I missed Penn Mac now. Forget cheese section Market District, Penn Mac bigger selection HALF price! They great specialty cheeses I can't find anywhere else, along ton specialty Italian products. I spent YEARS trying figure make pizza dough mediocre results. That time wasted! You get best pizza dough Penn Mac $1.50. Yes. 6 quarters. That's it.
You might forget macaroni part scent cheese hits you. This Strip District dream. What Saturdays made for.
They interesting selection food, customer service lacking opinion. I purchased single loaf bread I chance say anything cashier placed bag bread large plastic bag. I said "I don't need bag," I say twice registered her, gave hard time. She said something effect "you told before, don't un-bag." Seriously? Maybe should've asked I wanted bag! I half mind say something unpleasant response, I'm writing review instead.
This like Pittsburghs Dean Deluca without yuppie scum crazy prices. One favorite places earth. Growing close went "payday" grab eye-tlain (Italian) groceries. I get back every things gotten far touristy. This really hasn't changed anything long willing endure contingent confused looking browsers (tourist) getting way asking dumb questions. They pretty much cover Italian items. The olive cheese deli meat section pretty awesome. Get cheese, olives, little soppresata, loaf bread bread works find spot watch yinzers interact strip tourists Ohio trying give meaning lives. They sell bulk olive oil vinegar. They supply bottles corks. There's room pasta, canned tomatoes, salted cod such. Prices low considering quality get. Bring cooler. Cheese usually sold 1lb.
How I realize Harris cash only?
I bad experience staff- doctor helpful patient me, made experience much better
The staff Gateway made feel like customer used car lot. They pushy selecting expensive, unnecessary options ask customer choices want; simply write bill you. I told would $30 charge digital retinal photograph, I consented to. Other that, I informed services covered not. I given clarity explanation services added bill without asking me. For example, anti-glare lens warranty added staff member automatically, I actually stop object individual services, tried convince get anyway. I felt uncomfortable pressured services I never told cost I paying bill front desk. The cost exorbitant, I prepared based conversations staff. It cost $500 (after insurance coverage, quite good) get glasses contacts updated. I planning return Gateway future visits, I would never recommend others.
Extremely poor service. I called 10.30 walk-ins vaccination Chihuahua. I asked come hour. When I arrived, I rudely notified don't walk-ins Saturday. The person front desk could "not remember thing". Very unprofessional. This last time I try unclean rude establishment.
go it's close like sweetened iced coffee black. also hate crazy mocha lack making simple sugar sweeten iced drinks. truthfully, wouldn't go jeet open normal coffee hours. why? bad staff...well, one staff member particular .the woman front line totally polite her. totally opposite. rude .big attitude even thanks. really don't care one way sexuality don't take im guy.
The bathroom worse CBGB's was. I scared touch anything, even soap. Being "band room" made feel like I murdered. The art weird looked mostly like done high school class. There painting Eazy-E word AIDS painted across it. Uh....yeah. Small stage, sounded OK. 2nd degree celebrity sighting - promoter supposedly son Max Weinberg? Hi Boss!
Average Pittsburgh pizza fried stuff pile, nothing special though. Gyro good. Fried items arrive little cold soggy side.
After night imbibing, required pizza breakfast. On Sunday, delivered house. We decided try Calabria's, ordered pepperoni pizza, italian hoagie, side "hot pepper cheese balls". The pizza horrible- bad I couldn't eat it, believe NEVER happens. It weird odor, cheese like plastic, sauce closer ketchup. Their pepperoni like capicola, huge thin slices dry tasteless. But hoagie pretty good. You know, standard italian hoagie. It wasn't soggy surprising, I'd definitely order hoagie again. I try cheese balls; small, fried, orange spheres. Apparently though bit cooked.
Wow, I'm surprised one left review place yet. I've quite number times I've never disappointed. Service good food wonderful. This closest thing getting Chinese food D.C. You definitely get general tso's chicken. I drove way get food last years horrible winter storm. When craving, craving.
ate half cockroach. Gross. Never going again.
Being new Pittsburgh area, I really trying find go-to Chinese takeout place. Unfortunately, China house wasn't quite it. This place 2.5 comes food. Got Hunan chicken general Tao tofu spring roll. The food didn't taste fresh flavor bland. The tofu looked tasted like microwaved quite times. I probably wouldn't order again.
We came Friday night take out. My friend ordered Sesame chicken I orange chicken. Although friend one ordering, bit difficult determine orders since person taking call said additional $1 fried rice total came $10+ per dish. Gosh! We wanted sesame chicken fried rice! She finally said wanted combination platter came $8.29 each. The food ready quickly. We SO hungry! The meals came egg roll wasn't bad. However, forgot put utensils sauce. The food wasn't bad. It filling I expected. It wasn't anything extraordinary good enough. Lunch definitely good deal since dishes $5.50 so.
I member gym six months. For part, time enjoyable. The gym pretty small, everything you'll need, leaving pretty satisfied gym itself. Sadly, I cannot recommend gym anyone long trainer Dan works there. Dan would swear sets, talk behind back, leave equipment gym. Sorry everyone wants incline bench one two squat racks. I know I wasn't one felt disrespected man reason I took business street.
Every time I Cafe Sam I disappointed. On recent visit, waiter overbearing, menu confusing, food unremarkable. Avoid place.
I came Cafe Sam high hopes. Ritter's Diner directly across street I eat time. In mind place get better. As party three walks promptly seated manager. Looking menu, decide want order: French Onion Buffalo Chicken Medallions Fish Tacos salsa guacamole Cheeseburger (medium) apple sauce potato salad Side Fries Water Iced Tea Lemon Bread butter, olive oil infused pumpkin, drinks soon arrive. ALERT: The tea flavored. I really dislike flavored teas, I put extra lemon mine cover foul taste continued on. The bread slightly aged crust somewhat hard. The olive oil fairly tasteless, fresh. I would never use light olive oil tasting purposes like Cafe Sam did. While interesting thought add pumpkin seeds -- current theme -- didn't add much oil. At least butter soft rather frozen. As planned work next next day, Buffalo Chicken Medallions arrived. They need remove "s" Medallions piece. In fact, need remove "medallion" "buffalo" name call something else. It piece chicken breast dredged Cajun seasoning stray strands cheese melted it. Don't get wrong, didn't taste bad; better name would "Cajun Chicken Breast" rather call now. As I ate chicken, French Onion Soup arrived. This crock soup looked exceptionally good. The cheese top browned proper point. I took spoon cut voraciousness I could taste already. When I put first bite mouth though, flavor flat. I took another bite thing. This wasn't French Onion soup layers flavor, onion broth cheap, melted cheese top. It didn't taste bad, anyone could make soup. I ate half soup passed friend finish along rest chicken breast. I didn't want eat much able eat main course. As friend finished soup entrees arrived. The cheeseburger served piece larger sesame baguette came well done rather requested medium. I didn't try due fact overcooked sesame seeds. I try apple sauce potato salad, though. The potato salad tasty. One bite I didn't want take another. The apple sauce, hand, quite tasty -- I wouldn't call apple sauce, though. It along line fried apples -- damn tasty fried apples. As I wasn't cheeseburger, I ate fish tacos. The tacos arrived presented sprinkling iceberg lettuce. I would think make bed lettuce omit together. I latter former I don't eat iceberg lettuce -- nutrients, water. While fish didn't bad flavor, tad overcooked. When I started eat tacos, wasn't big deal. As fish cooled off, though, started get hard good. The fish tacos need cooked less, especially fact using white, flaky fish, easily overcooked. At least guacamole fresh tasted good. All all, lackluster event. If fried apples, guacamole, great service would one-star. I don't know I would ever willingly return since I sticker shock server brought check. The price commensurate quality food. People complain quality food Ritter's diner, food actually commensurate price pay. When I pay $20 person eat, I expect better diner fare.
As much I love food here, I'm sad say likely last time coming here. I realize coming party 5 Saturday night without reservation usually tough accommodate, yet I pleasantly surprised hostess told would move table around would 10 minutes. We waited 15-20 minutes watched 4 parties get sat asked taking long since told us moving table. The hostess defensive said shouldn't expect get sat soon without reservation Saturday night, asked told us would 10 minutes. She said needed seat people reservations could seat us completely refused acknowledge given us misleading wait time. I understand it's hard guage wait times, you're wrong simply apologize blame guests planned evening. When finally got sat, server Angel good Buffalo style salmon steak delicious. I really like food here, fact matter customer service tonight inexcusable. Even customer wrong, don't blame say "I'm sorry, but..." You simply apologize try defuse situation instead getting defensive escalating situation. If hostess simply said "I apologize wait taking longer expected, able seat 5 minutes" thanked us patience would never issue. I love food, I won't coming back.
I negative experience food service several years ago, agreed join friends dinner. It déjà vu again. Service good, meal terrible. I ordered fantasy chef salad, pile hot meat greens, combination I found unappetizing. By time I found small amt. lettuce bottom bowl, warm wilted. The turkey tasted really bad, like overheated microwave. They forgot cheese one piece tomato tiny pieces fruit rim. I sent back, I group seemed ok meals (tho one raving) I decided complain.
Food really okay. I ordered porter house steak rather good deal except really bland. I added salt black pepper myself. Also really strange waitress I asked soda. She forgets. I fine since I probably don't need soda anyways. I asked steak sauce like a1 cause meat flavor, said "okay,I get you." She brought back ketchup. I know places don't steak sauces like a1 fine, don't bring ketchup eat steak. She must thought I idiot, I am, seriously don't pass Heinz Ketchup steak sauce. Just repulsive.... I rather eat steak without ketchup. Just tell place doesn't it, don't give ketchup says steak sauce. What cruel waitress.
Under circumstances would I eat again. Lunch (we arrived time perhaps 3 tables filled) took us almost two full hours - 1.5 spent waiting food... substitutions things weren't available (but server didn't know 'til long ordered). When food came was, case burger, inedible (raw, gristly cold - I'm medium rare fan) slathered less 1/4 cup pink mayonnaise "sauce." The service terrible, well inexplicably slow manager "mansplained" trainwreck plate food could happened. And crazy, overstuffed menu got thrown bus primary reason food "getting away them." Even (cursory) "split cost you" discount $3 didn't assuage disappointment.
Very tasty food tonight everything cold escargot main entrée. Won't returning.
I don't think best record store I've ever to, I call fan location. The layout pretty nifty even though it's small shop amidst small shops, still character it. I gives rock vibe, twinged blues. The LPs cds center one big table name popping you. This disappointment comes play: weren't nearly enough alternative bands make want go back. They huge section dedicated new releases alternative artists, artists don't place center. It little confusing misleading me. As trying sell genre appeal individuals walking store. I appreciate old school rock center, lot bands seemed really obscure, perhaps weren't type genre I looking first place. It's nice place you're browsing I little disappointed selection. Overall, three stars. The staff seemed nice I would come back I area.
This first visit Paddy Cake. I pick little something diabetes support group I belong two. Yes, I aware irony folks. Just remember this, diabetics cakes sweets moderation! And little group evolved excuse get together play cards board games! Anyway, I picked small coffee cake occasion. This place treat walk into. It's got everything traditional bakery inviting. I read bad reviews Google customer service. I don't see why--their service seemed fine me. I haven't actually tasted cake yet, I can't comment it.
it's OK. I stopped bakery way bank, looking something satisfy sweet tooth. Nothing really caught eye got mouth watering. I ended picking two chocolate patties peanut butter filling ($4/both). I wasn't two impressed: cake seemed bit stale filling creamy. I say cakes didn't look half bad. But, seemed like Paddy Cake comparable bakery section typical grocery store disappointing since I'm always lookout mouth watering sweets.
My family ordered bakery OVER 20 YEARS- POSSIBLY 30?! Well, past 9 years so, I seen quality rapidly go downhill. Worse worse quality product, declining taste poorer ingredients plainly evident. Sloppier sloppier decorating, ruder ruder counter staff. We continued shop simply due location convenient, days really TAKING YOUR CHANCES whether items buy somewhat tasty TOTALLY INEDIBLE. Still, I try support neighborhood businesses much possible break heart trash review like this, things need said. They continue lot customers due location due people remembering good USED TO BE, folks back visiting old neighborhood, return bakery memories. But oh, standards fallen! We got cupcakes party last year November literally could eat, dry bad- went trash (not cheap either). Thank goodness small kiddie birthday get-together important occasion guests I would embarrassed front of. We considered getting wedding cake (again, order support neighborhood place) 2008 gave us hard time regarding even getting appointment cake consultation went another baker, west end. Looking back, I glad happened way. As daily items, breads usually decent donuts edible (not great, satisfactory) way much sickly-sweet frosting. Cookies usually fine sometimes cake decorating clearly done rush job it's sloppy beyond description. Danishes many items give impression something went sort wrong recipe, items heavy greasy fluffy flaky soft moist. Items seem overcooked undercooked. I wonder ever really taste test producing. Also I don't know get away serving pathetic cannolis Italian neighborhood- pastry cream zero ricotta, plus general- funky ingredients blantantly, obviously pre-fab, fillings seem freshly made, it's mass-produced tube. And low quality, make pay premium prices, OF COURSE! Nothing marked price name item, ask, counter staff consistently take disgusted tone treat like stupid, rolling eyes (the exception youngest girls work there, early 20s, consistently good polite helping customers). The mature ladies frequently say snarky things like: "That's cinnamon SPIN, that's cinnamon DONUT. That's DANISH, that's FRUIT PASTRY." If don't want answer questions, put labels tags names prices info, customers read terms expecting us use! Most recently, I picked birthday cake father's birthday, looked like child decorated it. Seriously. I could done better job myself. Maybe employing cheapest bakers decorators rather talented ones. If case, certainly shows. I think I DONE continuing try support "neighborhood landmark." Any time complain, seems good-- see need heed customer comments improve.
I positive bakery used better...something changed there. I walked day going barber across street made mistake asking filling cannoli. My response was, 'like riccotta stuff'. I bought half dozen take back office....and got sick. It clue soggy.
Service horrible. You receive ticket pick orderwhen say it's ready. We two specials day. Buffalo chicken salad spinach, sliced strawberries, Gorgonzola, pecans onions salad. I also also grilled chicken strawberry salad. I asked onions salad counter person assured would problem. After fifteen minutes (and three numbers called) went back counter check order. She assured us weren't forgotten ten minutes later comes orders. My friend's Buffalo chicken salad piled high French fries (A Pittsburgh staple I come find), plenty Buffalo chicken nicely spiced. This someone doesn't like heat. My salad came exactly stated three fairly large grilled chicken breasts. They cleaning close early holiday used excuse took long food. We ate quickly lunchtime greatly diminished wait food. Salads great tasting large enough satisfying. While eating someone kept coming taking condiments table. They didn't ask food everything alright. I would go back food don't expect kind service. That seems hard them.
We ran trying find sandwich shop called Sammies. Yelp said smithfield near 4th It must closed found 7/11 subway. We found Zorba's corner considering cold neither us felt like walking search food. We stumbled reading outdoor menu mentioning specials. The hubby ordered buffalo chicken salad special Wednesdays. I went gyro salad came side pita bread. The hubby's salad huge, topped fries plenty chicken, mention lettuce. He choose balsamic dressing I thought weird enjoyed it. The fries great, nice hot chicken mildly spicy little bit dry. My salad big mostly lettuce. At first I thought little scant lamb meat almost like loaves bread Jesus fed hungry, kept showing up. I little disappointed quality lettuce. I hate big crunchy chunks find close root, bitter matter much dressing use. So reason I give place 3 stars salad. Crunchy bitter lettuce, gyro meat luke warm instead hot 5 minutes made cold chilled dressing. Not mention dressing rather bland didn't add enough huge salad ended ordering cost 75 cents. The fact I order dressing even though little flavor disappointing. There enough seating simple tables chairs spread out, nothing fancy worth taking pictures for. It's almost like cheap cafeteria I don't mind foods good I wasn't impressed gyro meat chicken salad. Sometimes places day I won't count place yet. P.S bring cash only!!
The food decent time, freshness unpredictable. A little pricey don't go daily special. Salads usually good cost around $9. The regular gyros okay, certainly favorite among restaurants serve dowtown. I found chicken gyro mediocre, gave second chance thinking may bad batch, displeased second time well. Also, warned cash only.
I got worst salad life Zorba's. Iceberg mix, soggy fries hard tomatoes greasy piece "glazed" salmon top. Definitely I expecting based much people rave place.
Disappointing experience almost year since last time I here. Ingredients weren't fresh gyro heavy spices.
I've eaten before. Walking town I saw & thought I would see had. I decided go Steak Hoagie, & cheese sauce side. I waited 20 minutes get (on lunch break), & normally I wouldn't upset, people ordered started getting numbers called mine I started getting pissed off. Especially cooks kept making salads instead lunch. I've included depressing looking "Steak Hoagie". I know it's lunch rush thing sloppily put together. In addition, use steakum like meat. I expecting steak hoagie like you'd get Philly, & slabs reprocessed steak. I paid $5.75 sandwich, $0.80 cheese sauce tasted worse 7-11 cheese sauce, & $1.25 soda. The food terrible & cooks need get together.
I happen big tea fan, many different flavors loose leaf tea. The employees always friendly, I never come empty handed disappointed!
Holy smokes crazy tea place crazy. would 5, got 'guilted' getting coffee told I ordering last cup (after relented, someone else ordered me). granted, Christmas Eve people employees wanted go home. The excitement place evident mom's enthusiasm place tea expert. In tea arena, seen equal. The mustached tea guru works literally puts together different teas - intimate knowledge each.
J.P. Hearty die. If need beans, need Prestogeorge.
Is possible raise family place? Cuz so, I'm in. I previously stopped months ago deli sandwich seasonal flavored latte. It tasty nothing ordinary... Today I went intent researching espresso makers French presses. While staring quizzically merchandise man, I believe store owner addressed ridiculously helpful without pushy. He showed products, recommended coffees based preferences, even took time show magical roasting machines back. I wanted hug snuggle I afraid they'd ask leave I made purchase. I ended buying deli meats along 3 different flavors fresh coffee grounds. Every person Pittsburgh friendly I surely back again. P.S. Their baked goods white girl "can't even" good too.
This restaurant remained - longer I expected, frankly. But food ok, definitely great fairly forgettable. The wine list also forgettable. Overall, place I go I event, probably wouldn't think otherwise. It well-located Strip District though near bars, want able walk place place, place consider Italian mood for. Fairly pricey offer.
Lidia's upscale Olive Garden slightly better wine list. The biggest problem? Everything bland. They salt problem. They must kitchen. Everything needed it. The salads fairly good items had. The arugula salad pear walnuts Gorgonzola well dressed, beets cooked sweet level. The lamb chops awful. Lamb tasted like grill like lamb. I sent back. They replaced pork tenderloin served tomato sauce (needed salt) cheese melted top asparagus slice Roma tomato. It sad sad dish. The tomato hard rock. The tenderloin cooked. Just bad. I chicken piccata upon recommendation server. It lemon, capers green olives. The vinegar fought lemon vile way. The chicken flour coated slime feel mouth. Served bed spinach. That decent taste plate didn't sauce it. Bread awful. They foccacia skinny bread sticks tasted stale me. Served olive spread garlic white bean spread. They fine - fact rather tasty. The menu really odd. Just way laid choices. Two west coast fish selections. Halibut salmon. Coming west coast, I overlooked matter principle. But worse pasta trio. The concept olive garden. All eat three different pastas served table side. They cart sauté pan table. What about? Our neighbors ordered I heard talking server disappointment. But like things Pittsburgh people nice. They gracious lamb took pork replacement bill. I wonder Lidia would create menu like this. It doesn't match books shows all. It nothing support brand Lidia. Unless really trying take Olive Garden market.
I went crowded saturday night large party (8 people table.) I ordered spicy calamari. It spicy. It overcooked, like rubber, served plain white beans. Yuck. I won't go back. My boyfriend seafood dish. Most seafood also overcooked tasteless.
I disappointed meal here. I expected way Lidia's. As regular viewer show I expecting fresh / rustic Italian meals. What I ended stuffed pasta I'm 95% sure reheated microwave, bland mains, slow inattentive service. The highlight meal bread fresh ingredient used entire meal.
I really looking forward Lidia's. And really disappointed. Bread good. The cocktails good. The service attentive friendly (just don't get server dishing unlimited pasta hungry customer clearly hadn't reached limit unlimited servings). Too bad food wasn't good. The beet salad underwhelming. I calamari rubbery swimming tasteless chicken broth white beans. I felt even sad dining companion fond memories calamari. I suspect positive memories longer :( My dining companion osso bucco dry stringy. Another disappointment. And thus rating Meh. Which huge shame. But life goes on...
Oh Lidia's! How you've forsaken me! I came group friends talked calamari entree. Three five us got (the others osso buco pasta dish - osso buco good, pasta dish "meh") I wanted put face behind hands whimper embarrassment. The dish totally watered flavorful all. I ask made little less spicy, I think solution dilute sauce. But, another one us entree full strength, wasn't much better! I questioned whether I would come back again, I suppose I would answer yes that, someone else wanted go. After experience, I don't think I face disappointment another time.
Order pasta trio can't go wrong! I looove go lunch get pasta trio. For lunch, get unlimited servings three different pastas (one imported Italy) brought fresh served table-side skillet plus soup salad $14. Their Caesar salad delicious offer unique soups refreshing change normal wedding soup minestrone. It might high side lunch it's well worth it! Warning: may want nap get back desk. They also serve fresh breads spreads. I prefer green spread bean base contains knows else. The dinner pasta trio little expensive ($18 pasta $29.50 w/salad, trio dessert). I've soooo many different pastas there, I couldn't begin name all. Some favorites include pear ravioli, goat cheese ravioli, penne la vodka, penne arrabiata, gnocchi Gorgonzola sauce list continues. They typically serve one pasta contains meat two meatless pastas they'll make third meatless pasta vegetarians there. I don't typically order menu I've salmon pleased. I also recommend brunch. It's $25 per person includes variety anti pasta (probably rotating sample 10 includes anything soup, Caesar salad, various salads, meat trays, bean based dishes, marinated vegetables, quiche, etc), fresh breads assortment flavored butters (strawberry jam butter fav), one mimosa bloody mary, pasta trio entree, coffee tea, table full various desserts sampling. You can't go wrong. We go brunch family visiting everybody looooves it! I recommend making reservation brunch. They don't rush meal means service little slower typical restaurant pasta trio future, won't regret it.
This place horrible service. I waited (sitting bar non-the-less) 10 minutes loser bartender got drink menu. The food weak, I got Caesar salad wild bore stuffed ravioli. I horrible. It like took pulled pork stuffed spoonful ravioli. I return, many better restaurants town waste time one.
One word; gross. This Italian food - it's Pittsburgh italian food. The ravioli fresh - difficult restaurant make fresh ravioli? The decor tacky. The wine list lacking. I could rip place apart one disappointing meal, I'm going waste time. In short, avoid place! You much better kitchen!
Not place I'd return regular fare, overpriced quality. But brunch divine value.
My girlfriend REALLY hyped place I ended spending $110 terrible meal I couldn't even eat. I ordered Chicken Marsala (Waitress's favorite) disgusting. The sauce VERY powering drenched it. If wasn't bad enough Chicken cheap dark meat skin bones it. I ended leaving even though meals included dessert price. Won't going back here...
I visited Pittsburgh weekend excited try Lidia's since I son's outstanding restaurants New York. Lidia's major disappointment me. Decor service fine, issues there. But food something I would expect chain restaurant like Carrabba's Olive Garden. The quality seemed poor: bread soggy, greens salad dressings way salted, greasy, sloppy pasta sauces, huge portions slapped onto dirty plates greasy fingerprints edges. Plus, I spent entire meal swatting flies away table. I really puzzled experience. When dine Joe's restaurants, get sense every single ingredient hand selected highest quality presentation food shows care went it. I expected similar standard Lidia's. I wondered Lidia visits restaurant often whether knows quality food. Celebrity chefs often seem suffer issue: get involved many business ventures restaurants regularly, quality suffers. Sorry say it, I definitely won't back Lidia's.
I'm sure people like place much. The wait long, food came cold, pastas overcooked, gluey, greasy messes. The service friendly food poor. Will never go back.
What need know, I not, massive, chain restaurant. They seat several 100 people. It's like type restaurant find casino. It's upscale chain, it's basically chain. And, food tasty well prepared. They well.
What embarrassment. Rotten/black salad greens. A server black eye. Pedestrian "signature" pasta. Plates glasses left uncleared. Greasy, scratchy plates buffet. All $28 per person!
We finally made Lydia's unfortunately disappointing! The olive spreads come bread basket gritty tasteless. The lasagne I ordered flavorless well. The pasta lasagna nice texture. My husband ordered $42 steak, ordered mid rare bit cooked issue steak flavor dirty grill. The Tiramisu good also calamari appetizer terrific. The service good hovered much personally. We also several drinks.... So, end $180 left bad taste mouth..........
When first arrived, Host(ess), phone private conversation. I understand plumbing problem urgent, follow calls set aside least customers standing front seated. I really hear conversation apartment landlord seated celebration lunch. Next, waitress animated, seemed actor rather server. She seemed reciting words memorized script sincere. For salad, served "Caesar Salad". My husband Italy said many times, thing Caesar Salad Italy. Check Wikipedia site verification. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_salad And top that, It doesn't seem right serve salad turning yellowish color vibrant green. It appeared old, excuse restaurant serve old lettuce, especially Lidia's. The pasta delicious, things make hoping for, especially celebration meal Lidia's, disappointing. A preoccupied host, fake waitress old yellow lettuce,
A restaurant gone steeply downhill... It's roughly 2-3 years since I lidias, experience I remember decent food service... Tonight far different. Overall, let say restaurant becoming dated. Colors decor seem boring style. I didn't get warm feeling I place white clothes, $12 average glasses wine (like come - I looked crappy bottle came from) waiters everywhere. The service horrible. From hostess crew bar waitress, bad. The hostess forgot us, I reminded waiting (40 minutes - despite reservation), said "oh yes, I going get you"... But wasn't stood minutes set table. Rude. Did I mention service bad? Well, waiting glass wine (a steep $13.50 glass - definitely didn't live expectations). The bar staff wasn't concerned us weren't friendly all. They chatting basically ignoring us. When got table, took 10 mins meet waitress. Then took another 15 order. Then 50 mins get food!!! I pasta trio (remember meal takes time cook - ready made constantly served) wife porkchop. Honestly, typically enjoy restaurant food (just read Casbah review) food really so-so. My wife's pork chop fatty over-cooked (despite waitress specifically making note chef prefers cook medium). My pasta decent, I ate, requested seconds (which allowed trio give small portions).... However, seconds never came. Waitress didn't even know I told politely. Then blamed new staff working pasta routes... No good enough reason - sorry. Then bill. I ordered pasta trio $23 waitress asked I wanted upgrade Salad $2, I approved. However charged $36 pasta trio (which comes desert). I told mistake agreed ran back new check. Now I $10 salad $23 pasta trio. I expecting $23 +$2 salad upgrade. Nope. So I explained politely I ordered $23 trio (must have) mistakenly offered upgrade. I accepted. However I told I wrong didn't offer make right. Ugh. Seriously want fight it? Especially I know I appropriately (not like I trying score free meal). Isn't rule "customer always right"? Finally, felt like whole restaurant clientele declined. How many people see tie-dye shirt wearing hats (literally wearing hats 8:30pm fine dining restaurant)? We saw enough know isn't lidias expected. We won't ever go back recommend place. As far concerned - good reason don't problem getting reservation (because IT STINKS!). Avoid!
What disappointment. When water glass cracked hand server poured soaked us, known would kind evening. Worst part meal pasta trio--the limpest, pastiest, tasteless mass lukewarm pasta I ever served. One waiter saved day insisting I reorder, everyone else joint content let us stew. Every aspect experience substandard although I reordered, beet salad good. Overall, Lidia ashamed name place like that.
We looking forward food experience awful. The restaurant large modern decor hideous red plastic/leatherette chairs lunchtime character. There background music. The waiter young inexperienced. It seems Lidia famous longer involved cooking food like larger chain worse without quality control. Table cloth dirty, staff friendly decor furniture unkept. The best part breadsticks dips olive oil. Would recommend it.
Ate resturant business trip. We chose Lidia's it's excellent reputation downtown Pittsburgh area. I say I pretty dissapointed overall experience resturant. Our food average, nothing special. I gnocchi salmon (shared two us.) The service absolutely horrible. Our food took hour half come people entire resturant. Our waitress Carrie extremely rude really bad attitude. I would probably come back.
I popped Lidia's lunch going Heinz History Center Museum, right street. I'm area read good reviews restaurant, I wanted try it. It Saturday around noon I expecting huge crowd, hardly diners restaurant expensive meal, became apparent why. First, prefix brunch menu I found pricey (for quality). There salad bar old, wilted, over-dressed salad, different (old looking) pasta salads, sparsely covered meat board. For entree, I tried lasagna recommended waiter. It generous portion, tasted like freezer lasagna would purchase local grocery. The dessert bar best part. The nutella chocolate cake lemon cakes delicious. The tiramisu good, though, It runny, watery, much brandy it. The service strange. My server little absent minded awkward presenting menu. I wouldn't recommend place anyone, wasn't worst dining experience I've ever had.
Took friends town Lidia last night, disappointed. I couldn't understand people raving much. OVER Charge terrible food. None us could finish meals cause tasted bad even hungry. Our waitress looked dirty teeths...services ok, great. Olive garden away better place. This first time last time.
Sad hear mediocre reviews and, I haven't Pittsburgh year, I say that, we've always great food really great service past. Look forward back 'Burgh soon. Just say groupon complainers (which course you) . . .you got bargain, stop complaining. Don't try cheap nitpick restaurant death. Happens time nice!
Terrible never go back. From toothless busers pasta tastes like soup kitchen rewarm. Calamari fresh. Pasta trio worst sauce I ever tasted. I grew fresh tomato meat sauce worked chefs Italy. This would hit garbage less second I handed serve. Seriously attempting show class.....Do hire people look like walked trash bin! Toothless busers asking remove dishes I eating Unacceptable.
Horrible. Baby Girl bought groupon, revisited 4 yr hiatus. I don't remember bad. Wettest, limpest Caesar salad I ever had, couldn't finish half it. Pasta trio bizarre. Three disjointed pastas fight flavor piled plate. Penne undercooked. Fettuccine flaccid. Only passable pasta pear & ricotta ravioli. Too rich, though. We hour fifteen minutes, two courses, wasn't busy. Waitress walked away two times opening bottle wine. Crazy. We got tiramisu go, I couldn't deal place more. Lighting distracting, felt like I food court mall. Carpet jacked up. Looked like fraternity house carpet. Clientele strange...lots sleeveless T's baseball hats. I didn't even see one time I Olive Garden. Staff inattentive bothered. I really looking forward going, love (tangentially) related restaurants Babbo & Esca. Never again.
I pasta trio. None pastas flavor. The server bring graded cheese pepper couldn't found request any. I got one small spoonful pasts wasn't offered opportunity check dropped server. I used really love Lidia's. It long time I risk another flavorless expensive meal I walk away hungry served. They even serve bread.
You get pay for. Tried $70 Groupon Pasta Tasting Menu wine paper seemed like good deal. It cross Olive Garden Buca di Bepo. The Caesar salad fine, inspiring. The three pastas very, basic. Only one, linguini cream sauce hint protein (small flecks pancetta); OK one tried small second helping of. The bow ties red sauce worth time, ravioli cheese worth calories. The tiramisu dessert tiny portion also impressive. The craziest wine pick "$32 List." All basic "jug-type" wines retail $8 bottle....so four times retail. The thing saved evening disaster server busser. Both polite, helpful friendly. So even Groupon, tax tip you're talking $95....The poor slobs paid full price would get hit $104 plus tax tip...$135...yikes!!!!
After watching Lidia's Kitchen I thought I'd try even though I heard pricy. It Like The lidia's program Wqed. I think Lidia &Grandma would appalled! I salad red wine vinegar&EVOO dressing request. Someone kitchen charge salads don't know make proper easy dressing! I retired Sous Chef 10 yrs retired resort hotel Miami beach. So I appalled lousy fresh dirty salad! Yes dirty! The endive bottom cores wasn't washed properly. The veggies tomatoes gross dressing mixed oil vinegar herbs! I pushed away ugh! Then I gnocchi Mom used make scratch ! This wasn't that! This frozen gnocchi I supermarkets size taste find store fresh made! Don't fooled! It came w duck ragu ice cold! They must forgot heat up. Desert time! Well I still hungry order coffee Tiramisu old soggy mess! Last piece fridge seemed like. I hate Olive garden Lidia's made good! Next time want Italian& nice prices go Alexander's Bloomfield pastas made order kitchen says menu may take 10 extra minutes prepare since make order! Try Calamari Angel hair yum! Until Lidia's comes inspects & teaches staff cook recipes makes tv! I made recipes really great simply Gross& high priced too!& I went Access didn't pay $7.00 valet parking fee!
Lidia embarrassed. We eaten Felidia Becco place bears little resemblance them. Food came burnt multiple times different dishes. I don't think know sauté spinach without burning it. Lamb shank: Luke warm Grilled octopus: where's octopus? Maybe oil? Lemon chicken: first time- burnt, second time undercooked missing capers olives. Spinach burnt times. Welcomed table with: "do y'all know ya'll's spreads are?" Waitress nice it's obvious place run poorly. Staff training badly needed. Lidia ashamed put name place.
What huge disappointment. Bottom line: Horrid service, mediocre food. There one hostess stand greet us, waited several minutes. An unenthusiastic hostess finally seated us. The tables set tablecloth, silverware, napkins only. No wine glasses anything make table look pretty. There cheap amber candle, lit one ever lit us. The hostess laid menus table walked away. Our server nice rushed. The place seemed understaffed even though lots people rushing about. The server explained menu asked drink orders. We trying decide wanted order bottle wine, asked minutes. A minutes went server rushing around never looked us see ready order. We flagged ordered bottle wine, placed food orders time. A minutes later salad date's appetizer arrived, wine. I half way salad wine presented - definitely top quality service. My salad small, unattractive, drowning dressing. There absolutely care thought put salad. My date's bruschetta appetizer bland. My date ordered special prix fixe dinner three courses; I ordered pasta sampler. They brought date's pasta course I sitting empty salad plate front me. No one came take salad inquire I would like start pasta course date his. Date finished pasta chicken entrée presented. I presented with...an empty plate. It minutes pasta sampler servers came give dollop. Then several minutes two pastas came by. After I got three pastas, one came ask good I wanted more. Which I really didn't since mediocre little flavor. In meantime, date unimpressed chicken. It undercooked, rubbery bland; vegetables served overcooked. Given issues timing drinks dinner overall lack attention, server finally came check us, told weren't happy said would send manager over. (This something I learned reading Mario Batali, says, issue restaurant, take care table.) We told manager issues, apologized meeting standards restaurant, said would make adjustment. If possible, service got WORSE talked him. I used ladies' room I came back, dirty plates still front us. At point one pasta servers finally came see I wanted seconds - I'd done eating away table least 5 minutes.It minutes server came take plates remind us date got dessert meal. I looked clock see long would take get dessert: 12 minutes. And dessert came ice cold solid rock. The server asked liked it, said ok (which kind), credit offered bring us dessert menu let us pick something else. But point done. When got bill, manager comped pasta sampler, literally least could since cheapest item cost nothing prepare since making huge batches anyway. Definitely disappointing corporate-type restaurant like decent reputation. Not recommended, won't go back.
Party 4 12/28 disappointed. We dozen times brunch dinner. This WORST experience spending $200+. Horrible service food bland. When speaking Manager, stated flown supposedly TURN restaurant around. Lidia spend time restaurants see first hand. The waiter said comes town twice year. Your brand damaged staff doesn't seem care. Very disappointed. Most likely return. ---Brian K
The food good. As close eating Italy gets Pittsburgh. So, it's disappointment run third-rate service today Sunday Brunch. There literally good service whole visit. Some lowlights include waiting long server greet us, slow refill beverages, aggressively rub nose two fingers taking order, rudeness server dessert table (I asked dessert hand, "What WHAT?"), offered refills pasta tasting picked sons plate clear it. Didn't completely ruin experience, value good quality food. A years back, none problems. There quality control outside kitchen today.
Maybe valentines day, super busy prix fixe menu, food good. Service great, unfortunately dishes bread dessert extremely disappointing. Definitely worth price.
Expensive suuuuper slooooooow. Not busy still took hour get food. Food ok.
Disappointed best way describe experience. Being big fans Lidia's ...and swearing cookbooks ...we expected terrific experience. We ... disappointed. Our antipasti largely bland uninspired. The chicken livers best lot, though crispy onions piled top desperate need salt. Our main dishes equally mediocre. The wild boar ravioli tasted fine, presentation seriously lacking. The gnocchi fine ...but bites, lost appeal. The duck breast done. And wine glass stingy pour given cost. All could forgiven ...but waitstaff performance could not. The waiter adjacent table spun around slammed back husband's head ...without word apology. Another parked tray food another table aisle blocking another member party returning seat, without sort acknowledgement finally returned move it. Our waiter least pleasant enough, clearly uninformed food serving. He least know pronounce "thyme".
Embarrassingly bad. Despite established business, it's seemingly run novices. Incorrect orders brought tables server steering us away signature offering (Pasta Trio) busy lousy way serve customers. Really wanted like here, never going back. While perfect, you'll better experience Eleven, nearby Smallman.
professional chef's restaurant "pasta" mediocre. fake Italian finest. lamb good though
So, so, priced! Tried business function reserved room, charged $80 - $90 per person. Yet food ... well, plain. Not many choices, food (had ordered menu, would $40 tops). The wine selection so. It seems like business function tried rake massive amounts profits without actually offering anything good. The appetizers horrendous, sorry ... kind fried shrimp, shrimp undercooked (each one them) one translucent instead white bite ... greasy, like went $10 diner $100 per person high end place. The asparagus accompanied meal overcooked went limp wilted, greasy (again! asparagus!) ... could've steamed 5 minutes without cooking tasted 10 times better. I sorry, feels over-priced over-rated. It over-paid under-enjoyed meal I ever business function. This third visit first one business function - two prior times fine, great; third time disastrous.
It 2:45pm restaurant closed. It actually closes 2:00 - 5:00 pm Mon- Fri. The information restaurant needs updated! The restaurant's information currently listed Yelp shows restaurant "open" right now.
Last week husband I visited Pittsburgh rock concert. We stayed fantastic hotel next door Lidia's, decided dinner there. It disappointing meal. I ordered Pasta Trio, husband ordered Risotto. The Risotto arrived tasted - must used low sodium stock...this dish absolutely flavor all. There salt pepper shakers tables. My first two pasta samples arrived. One good ravioli type sage filling. The fusilli red sauce ordinary extreme. When waitress checked in, nearly half hour later, informed I'd never received third pasta, husband's dish unsalted bland. She left 10 minutes later, I received third pasta, wide noodle chicken reduction sauce. Not exciting. For $33 I expected more. It pasta, all, one small serving each. I dessert, 3 flavors gelato. The flavors good enough, menu. All all, money paid, time spent (over hour half) restaurant merit 2 stars. A shame, since menu interesting restaurant roomy nicely decorated. There seemed plenty waitstaff - somehow waitress either running place disappeared long lengths time. This place needs help.
My husband I town concert. I always loved watching Lidia TV thought would real treat eat restaurant. Unfortunately, big disappointment. We went late lunch around 1:30. I ordered chicken scaloppine chose soup. The soup described server fennel, spinach bean soup. What I received void fennel spinach. It thick cup white beans tomato base. Also, bland. No salt pepper shakers tables. This drives crazy. The scaloppine wasn't much better. My husband ordered sausage peppers polenta. I think got maybe 4 ounces sausage peppers. This restaurant overpriced product received. Very disappointing.
This place pretty poor really needs get it's act together it's disgraceful place watch football, especially given accessibility technology days. First off, desperately need updates. There old crappy projector screens big rear projection TVs, HDTV sight. There TVs aplenty, feel dinghy outdated reception every TV snowy. The biggest issue, however, apparently they're able show 6 games 1 time throughout huge bar area. There several main bar islands, booths, pub tables individual TV screens booth. Sounds good, good seats show 6 games? That absurd consider huge Sports Rock is, especially college football. I went watch game regular old ESPN, weren't showing game. You mean I could go hotel watch game unable watch "sports bar"?? Give break. Food also generally terrible. Nachos better get 7-11 sandwiches flavor. And service piss poor understaffed. I'm sure recently changed ownership what, something obviously unprepared start football season. I feel bad people nice apologetic, take away fact even showing game, I think I'd still rather watch hotel room.
I think typically sports bars really expected good food. They need four things 1. ESPN 2. Nachos pilled high kinds stuff 3. beer specials 4. big screen TVs. Well Sports Rock failed accounts. I encouraged walked saw individual TVs table. Of course picked one didn't work! Then realized many market games, Virginia Tech one nowhere seen. So politely ask ESPN. Not ESPN U 360 anything fancy. Plain old regular ESPN. Then get story six recievers. Thats fine. But watching Maine/Iowa game. SERIOUSLY. I also annoyed cute girl walked bar, Georgia game within minutes. The nachos absolutely disgusting wrap leaked oil disgustingness. The fries even terrible, found dipped gross nacho cheese, weren' bad. Plus, beer 4.75! Multiply 3 hour game you're paying lot. Service awful think would get better reception tv rabbit ears. Overall place sucked, although give credit finally getting leave go Irish Bar able show ESPN, noticed hokie game way back corner. Took long enough. If you're ever Pittsburgh need watching ESPN heres idea. Grab permanti brothers sandwich six pack beer watch hotel room rather waste money sit watch Maine vs Iowa crappy little tv reception.
What see get. This typical sports bar packed TVs loud noises. There three bars joint plenty space had. There booths individual TVs booth, regular size tables tables large groups. There also outdoor seating. There arcade style sports games, electronic dart boards, pool tables. There also appeared 2 small stages. The TVs ok. They several projection TVs average picture. I didn't check "regular" TVs see HD not. I like jersey wall. They Ripken, Namath, Mario, Selanee, Montana, McGwire, couple others I can't remember. They Hold 'Em tournament evening (they one every Tuesday apparently). They setting leaving I'm sure supposed work. We wings beer. The beer average price ($4.75 23 oz) wings good (they several different flavors). Our waitress ok. She young hottie kind slow, dense side. Also, waitresses nice look roamed premises. As someone mentioned earlier, wear tight shirts small shorts resemble referee's outfit. This place close "The Strip" right next Heinz sports museum Hampton Inn. We walked Mellon arena took 20 minutes. If you're looking place watch game want typical sports bar experience, get here. Just don't expect much.
I order food delivery hotel. I got chicken carbonara. It came salad toast BOMB. It delivered piping hot lot food I ordered individual size enough two people. I also got slice strawberry cheesecake.
Hard find location, zero atmosphere (there old car tires place, along aging ping pong table) pizza came disappoint. Recommend dive pizza meal.
I gave place 2 stars environment in. A "hard find place" understatement it's dark outside never here. I agree, crust pizza amazingly flakey delicious. I'm crusty guy, I like good crust though it's soft boboli it's still easy eat won't rough mouth. I ordered Ephesus Pizza lamb skewers ($16.00 large). It white pizza minimal ingredients except lamb skewers. They packed 8-9 small skewers lamb I admit, lamb tasty tender. The problem I place filthy, trash laden environment sits in. It's mezzanine level (2nd floor) financial building I got there, exterior doors building locked luckily group people showed punched code get one side doors opened...it strange. However, walk side door, I faced stairwell trash cans spewed about. I entered pizza/sandwich joint, disarray, bread crates floor trash cans overflowing. The bathroom construction zone filthy. All added afraid eat anything unsure fresh food well kept kitchen may may been. I'm fluffy guy, I need fluff establishments...look clean, feel clean, feel safe I live whatever dish out, first impressions nasty dirty, hits homeplate way food hits mouth. I still like pizza I send pot smoking, beer drinking partying friends place, I would afraid others may think consequently, think tastes.
What taste!!! Just obsessed food. Definitely try Turkish food fabulous!! (mixed grill Ephesus pide one favorites)
Pretty okay pizza. Standard so-so Pittsburgh pizza. However , fact delivery driver expected run second floor apartment middle street get okay. He rude I asked come up, talking deliveries make couldn't park (meanwhile, multiple open parking spaces directly front apartment; well entire parking lot right next door). After arguing minutes, finally decided park come up. I really don't want argue someone get job I order delivery. And I certainly don't want leave house, go cold, supposed delivery. Is strange expect food delivery make actual doorstep? This seems recent trend, pizza delivery people expecting customer run street get pizza. It stopped ordering another place, stop ordering Ephesus again.
After ordering credit card number stolen. Since place I used number weeks, I assume stolen someone here. Not savvy business practice.
Too oily , felt like im eating pure fat , even bread covered oil ! I suggest make healthier whole wheat option, grape leaves dry tasteless. Oh fries terrible
Incredible pizza. Dirty, rude, disgusting employees. I think that's actually slogan.
Three stars gave food good service bad. Should go don't get angry
Delivery: Horrible experience. We waited 2 hours food delivered. The owner idea food dispatched food made. She promptly explained internet down. However, grubhub notification indicated otherwise. The owner essentially lied delivery.
My pizza 20 min late, granted I live Mexican war streets ally apartment building clearly marked building front door facing ally. He asked come outside look him... Please can, order Bellevue location I used live would order time. never caused problems.
Food awesome! But service hell noooo! Terrible! I waiting pick long also women works rude!
crooks overcharge grubhub increase price. stay away don't try crooks. food terrible customer service. better restaurants pittsburgh. piss poor excuse turkish restaurant.
I ordered 2 pizzas, gyro fries special recognition one co-workers. chose restaurant ratings wanting try something new. I ordered grub hub. order include free cheesy bread two-2 litre drinks. spot leave instructions. I asked pizzas cut squares (they show way photo) one drinks diet. After receiving food 30 minutes past promised time, I called. I spoke politely, asking food would delivered hung on. I called back 15 minute increments (each time given different excuse) could get ahold driver, traffic. I explained celebration would let know wasn't coming I could order another restaurant. They finally agreed cancel order. This 2 hours I placed order. As soon I hung phone, food delivered. I receive free cheesy bread drink order incorrect. pizza sliced squares I receive French fries. I sent message grub hub said talked establishment nothing it. I would careful ordering food here. The service poor.
I ordered boneless wings garlic sauce terribly hard well salty. Delivery fine food terrible. Never ordering again.
I know worse, delivery, cold food, lack customer service. Lost business customer given $300 business day cares attitude. This place sucks!
Very dry bland kebabs .. disappointed!!
I wanted try new place ordered pizza 6/27 arrived driver took pizza trunk cheese (not surprisingly) slid entirely whole pizza corner pizza box. I showed driver, told call new one. I called them... nothing say, promised send new pizza never came. Unacceptable. I'll choosing another place next time.
Freindly staff....good cheese....can't wait try aftermentioned "#7"
Roethlisberger w/ bacon pepper relish.
I received 2 hoagies (half-assed crap) Peppi's Strip friends' daughters dance fundraiser day. I paid $6.50 SMALL 8" - smushed bread, hardly meat wilted lettuce hoagies!! Are kidding me?! What rip off!! I ordered hoagies place types fundraiser functions well sold hoagies years child. THESE HOAGIES ARE THE MOST PATHETIC hoagies I've ever seen eaten!! You Embarrassed ashamed even selling these!!! What joke!! I NEVER purchasing eating Peppi's ever again. Horrible!
It's ok great, could really benefit refresh, felt looked dirty...
Last time I stayed three years ago - stayed three nights. This time one overnight only. The AC room working well. It enough cool room - still felt tad humid side. Again, another really old hotel inefficient, antiquated central AC system. Given nature building, I doubt could ever retrofit building necessary HVAC infrastructure improve it. I could wrong. One plus last time I stayed old analog style, CRT-based TVs gone - least room I stayed newer flat panel HD TV set. As previous review: - If staying - please note hotel convenience store - limited number items sale front desk. If need toiletries, beverages, snacks items - 7-Eleven street - CVS Rite Aid additional block - BUT - forewarned - none three options stays open late. We attempted visit 7-11 CVS - 10:00 pm three years later ar still keeping limited hours. And can't get food Braddock Bar Hotel lobby 10:00 pm so. Very annoying.
The first impression hotel trying get valet parking area order check it. The hotel busy street maybe 2 spots available front park valet. We circle around twice wait spot open up. We checked in, put stuff room, left. When came back room later, boyfriends shorts placed chair room soaking wet smelled like urine. We idea sudden would soaking wet smell awful. Later on, realized soap anywhere bathroom. You're paying like $400 night soap. I called front desk said I hotel room soap. The person answered responded saying "thanks" hung up. I super confused reaction. About 30 minutes later someone came soap. It super rude way dealing situation. The front desk could said would send someone soap instead saying thanks hanging up. The next morning tried leave nearly impossible. The elevators busy didn't stop floor 10 minutes waiting. We decided use stairs led dead end. We walked back followed people trying exit well said thought elevators must broken. That led emergency exit couldnt use. We climb back stairs second floor somehow found way grand entrance staircase. It took 30 minutes climbing stairs find way hotel. The whole experience absolutely ridiculous. I'd gladly pay bit stay Fairmont next time.
The absolute loudest hotel I've stayed long LONG time. Paper thin wall, poor booking practices ended us middle obnoxious wedding party ever. Drunk bride, hotel room parties 3am, apparent lack security monitor anything going hotel lead rave early Saturday morning (and I mean RAVE quite literally) review. And yes front desk called several times noise complaints. My best tip would stay unless purpose stay sleep.
Well got greeted doormen nice. Upon entering smelled sewage dark. It seem little unwelcoming little dated. We stayed night upon awakening 10:00-10:30 already people knocking door see still (cleaning crew/ check 12). An hour left I realized I left blanket room called let know. I transferred housekeeping I constantly sent voicemail. 2 messages, multiple calls, days later I finally got talk actual person told extensive laundry facility husbands number come across call. So 3 weeks later still heard one word. I've expected threw away even though I told would never happen. It unfortunate blanket family 30 years. Stay Omni near by.
I would otherwise lovely stay, management checkout process turned horrible nightmare. Their system accidentally charged different amount, refunded me. However, person checking saw refund, instead trusting computer system insisted I undercharged insisted charging again. I tired, packed bags, waiting get Airport. Despite fact seemed wrong, kept assuring math worked right. Well, I get home, see I overcharged exactly amount, I definitely due refund. I called one manager, directed accountant. I didn't hear back. Days later, I called again, time another manager kept talking wouldn't answer simple questions. Kept redirecting saying I math wrong wasn't charged, first charge wasn't bill, original refund computer automatically gave me. I told I credit card statements show wrong, told I bring credit card company. Extremely rude dismissive, like first employee manually overcharged me. Finally, I called accountant directly, finally agreed yeah I overcharged extra night gave refund. Hours phone fighting get refund, talked like I stupid can't math system messed up, top all... I asked maybe 2 3 times least 2 different people make sure process rewards number attached. They said yes, I confirmed been. By far, worst hotel staff experience I ever had. I would never stay hotel again.
Meh, it's clean modern convention center, often case, everything bit over-priced lower quality. Coffee disgusting brown water. They over-charged us billing things didn't order get, took multiple times asking fix it.
The Pittsburgh Auto Show held David L. Convention Center. This place great venue LARGE crowd plenty room. Lets start parking, parking crazy expensive. They different options people. You could park fairly close pay $6-12 offer shuttle service. You park convention center pay $12. Im sure know way around Pittsburgh, theres parking garages lots city. Walking option due sub zero wind chills. We opted park free Rivers Casino take shuttle over. We lucked go shuttle without waiting cold. The shuttle back, little bit wait (5min cold). Now, bought tickets line avoid CRAZY long line went way outside. It terrible waiting line, moved quickly. They 5 lines set up, 3 credit cash 2 cash only. The cash lines moved quickest shortest lines. It $12 piece wife I get in. I think pretty reasonable get in. They give discount military members senior citizens ($2 off). Children 12 free. Lets talk prices drinks. Now, I understand ints convention center need make money, BUT small coke bottle water cost us $6.50. $6.50 2 items CRAZY!!!!! Domestic beers $7.50. I mean thats absurd charge prices!!! The auto show disappointment. They lot cars look at, two I cared see Nissan GTR ( there) Focus RS (locked). Whats point showing cars can't even sit them. That frustrating!! It pretty busy people everywhere. It annoying fighting crowds look certain cars. There sales people around answer questions cars. All all, disappointment year. We might go every year, maybe every year. The plus fact car shopping, would good place see cars sit one roof.
I town interview didn't pay room, corporate rate got $97. Pretty awesome. Self parking (I think) $8 per day. Cheap! This expect Westin--that heavenly scent, Heavenly bed soft sheets, Heavenly bath towels. This particular Westin uses energy-saving program. They'll tell insert key card get door room powers lights AC. I'm fan I request two keys--I insert one keep AC running I room use key get room. Sorry, I'm returning hot hotel room waiting cool down! I disappointed see didn't offer complimentary bottled water SPG rooms...I guess reality economy hitting cutting back that. Bummer.
I understand new obsession hotels' "green." We offered chance decline housekeeping (is give excuse fire employees?) turn one two awesome showerheads (what awful idea), forced insert keycard light switch order turn lights. None big inconvenience, seemed bizarre me. And unlikely significant relative bigger decisions like using energy-efficient machines wash sheets, quality insulation save heating cooling, on. Maybe Westin things too, I don't know, seemed like little annoyances room marketing gimmick substantive step. (And like previous reviewer, noticed faint smell sweat human body odor room.) Beyond that, it's fine--parking isn't cheap, wireless unreliable slow, in-hotel food options dubious--but it's squarely middle ranks I come expect downtown hotels secondary American cities.
We got hotel room via Hotwire great price. The location good, although close headed town. It easily accessible highway. Parking hotel expensive. My biggest complaint shower wasn't clean. The walls rooms thin; could hear neighbor's dog barking, well people using showers/bathrooms. Overall, needed room (sleeping show), fine. But thin walls, expensive parking, dirty bathroom, i'd never stay place again. I've better experiences smaller, cheaper hotels.
I stayed week ago impressed. The staff friendly informative really nice (in comparison rest Pittsburgh). We took shuttle ever went (which bonus). But something place seemed slightly unclean. The countertop bathroom wasn't clean around taps, bathroom general seemed un clean. We ordered room service food wasn't bad, something star hotel sell. There also bathrobe slippers. I impressed witht that. Overall, bad hotel, lacking price.
Stay times year love it. Never problem. Their customer service goes beyond. I get email stay (from real person I respond to) there's info I need know. For example, got one today stay weekend inform bunch streets closed Sunday due Pittsburgh Marathon, along specifics get to/from hotel time. Can't beat that!
completely worthless wifi.
We packing now, academic conference new guidelines implemented throughout states. The beds Westin comfy, pillows. I thought nice stay. ***Wifi $15.95 day**** This highly annoying. This per room per computer. My husband paid fee network connected computer. When away conference, I access wifi. The television seems also go black several times programs.
We always stay Westin Hotels. We Starwood Preferred guests. We NEVER problems complaints. We stayed Westin Hotels country. But place downright disgusting. Where start.... No fitted sheets beds? Have call unlock mini fridge? The "green energy saving" light switches? The TV movies didn't work? The place dirty. From vents, phones, outlets light switches, trash liners, lack towels. We kept call towels. OH house keeping! We left two times day asked come clean room BOTH times. We came back second time wasn't cleaned? I called complain told send someone hour going nap. Two seconds later, come want clean? I furious. We excited indoor pool hot tub. I wouldn't step foot hot tub ever again. Unless want catch disease. So gross. Paint chipping inside. The pool strictly lap pool. And women's locker room nasty. Looked like hadn't cleaned month. I'm giving hotel 1 star can't give zero. The plus shuttle service driver. Don't stay here, save money.
After looking hotel online I excited, pictures looked new nice. I town attending conference convention center along great everything looked, couldn't beat location. However, I absolute worst hotel experience Pittsburgh Westin. I Starwood Preferred Guest member great experiences, one bad really makes question integrity brand I hesitant stay another Starwood establishment. Even tonight I try log SPG see points "conservative" room updated, I can't logon site "The system temporarily unavailable." I also note I photographs everything, I couldn't believe bad stay was. 1. The terrible experience happened I even arrived. When I googled hotel, accusations bed bugs appeared Yelp.com Bedbegregistry.com - hotel yet take time respond. A simple detail someone paying attention would able resolve. 2. I arrived hotel 7+ hour drive find bathroom hotel room broken. After two calls Guest Services, 30 minutes later maintenance man came by, took 15 minutes fix it. So total 45 minutes I could use rest room arriving. I suggested Guest Services second call move new room awkwardly laughed off. 3. After using restroom (finally!) I noticed tub dirty mold top shower rod top inside mini-fridge. The mold "new" could easily wiped taken care room properly clean attention detail paid. The fact hotel lacked ability simple house keeping surprising. 4. The paint various places room chipping furniture, notably side table knicked scratched badly. 5. Because bed bug reviews, I stripped sheets look evidence. I find any, become aware many brown black tar stains sheets tucked mattress. 6. I begrudgingly ordered room service late time I got settled. I ordered Turkey BLT lemon aioli arugula salad. Instead I got cold, what-seemed-like-day-old deli meat, burnt bacon thin, thin layer mayo, aioli. The arugula salad 1 piece arugula - mixed greens shredded carrots instead. When read description look I actually received, very, disappointing. 7. The coffee pot room leaked off, wetting sugar, napkins, etc. 8. They charged wrong credit card office manager telling several different people card charge. I booked room corporate card, office manager believed straightened everything front desk charge card file I would corporate card me. The first thing I asked front desk credit card. After I explained situation front desk, insisted card file would charged needed card "incidentals" - back fourth I gave gave card, assured would charged. Then I checked two days later, I confirmed would charge card file still charged wrong one. Fast forward following week I notice charges, I called billing department someone still yet return call. I charged interest card mistake. This absolute terrible experience I disappointed Westin Starwood Hotels obvious lack pride detail hotel.
Really poor service way overpriced. You could make much better choices.They keep high standard service. The rooms worth money.
This 2nd stay since I unload car valet bring 5 suitcases room valet car I already disappointed service. I actually get elevator luggage people big cart. Disappointed Fairmont vacancies. Ditch hotel.
Had sheets changed I got room. Stains towels. Worst elevator system I've ever come across. Should tell need know.
Rude front desk staff. Travelled 4+ hours car come see Penguins game. Booked room 2 double beds via Travelocity. Received confirmation email room booked...well, showed check low & behold -- rooms double beds available, they'd happy put us room single King. Not end world mind you...that staff questioned, politely, "confirmation" means? Talk nasty look attitude. Definitely move along give place wide berth....there plenty places treat you, consumer respect dignity. Hell, least folks @ Motel 6 leave light you.
I previously rated hotel 1 star (I legit reasons based customer service experience). However, hotel management contacted line seemed genuinely apologetic worked make things right. While initial experience may lived Westin name, follow certainly did. This leads believe issue I encountered systemic -- merely one situations someone might bad night. Consequently, I've raised review 3 stars give another try future.
I sooooo disappointed hotel. I'm sure use wash sheets towels sheets dry harsh I could barely sleep. We asked front desk it. They offered replace sheets "brand new ones" can't even tell difference. The AC barely works. Our room stuffy hit entire time. Bottom line: way uncomfortable costing much did. I'll never stay again.
2.75 stars. Mostly The extremely Friendly staff AND The GREAT view From OUR Room On The 24th Floor. The sheets seemed cleaned (and I didn't see bed bugs) clean thing. The light switches, crevices, phone, corners shower/tub horrendously filthy. As pictures depicted, terrible job cleaning. But maybe they're even trying! Maybe changing sheets extent effort. Parking overpriced city like Pittsburgh 2 hour limit, 4$ hour, ridiculous opinion. Again Pittsburgh NOT Philly, DC, NY. Breakfast options immediate area almost nonexistent.
This Westin conveniently located near convention center, low relative rank amount stars deserved. I hotel twice month. This Westin bottom tenth. The coffee maker disgusting smells. The beds constantly short-sheeted, mostly poor effort. The phones clocks gross. I gave management heads up, fixed. Bottom line... They don't care, don't frustrate risk dirt. On bright side, woman elevator insistent something bit last night, I seem dodged bullet.
From someone loves hotels - far worst Westin I EVER stayed - truly brand take name property. From substandard housekeeping truly poor service, I cannot recommend another hotel choice enough. Disappointing every turn.
This hotel live Westin standards I'm used too. I stay business purposes would never recommend place anyone stay EVER! The hallways smell rooms clean all. Below photos recent stay.
Horrible, go Long John Silver's. I hear oyster bar think delicious raw oysters deep fried crap .
Ice cream break!
My parents I came dad boasted good food would bring HP customers lunch. Upon arrival immediately ignored ended seating ourselves. The place unacceptably dirty, table dirty floor dirty, heck even walls seemed layer grime. Both waitress bartender extremely rude. My mom I got beer dad tried order martini, immediately received dirty looks bartender waitress, said didn't dad asked straight vodka glass brought shot vodka instead. I understand it's full bar classy place serve alcohol react way servers ridiculous! I ordered grilled fish sandwich lacked flavor horrible greasy, fried scallops disgusting. I understand restaurant seen better days wow, going back, methinks not!
I ended mistake meeting friend dinner busy night picking least busiest spot quick bite. After meal I asked waitress directions key ladies room. Why it's locked I don't know. On way back dining room rat ran kitchen across dining room front feet! Totally gross!!! I'll never eat greasey spoon disgusting! And there's recourse it's cash I assume appease rats.
This restaurant horrible. The waitress rude tried rush us. The oyster menu terrible patty kind. How call Oyster House serve either fried oysters raw??? The food overall ok. I would never go eat again!
Not I expected! This place Pittsburgh institution. I expected mahogany brass, walked tiny diner. Very friendly. The fish awesome. The huge Calimari rings absurdly tender. No gumminess all. The place crazy lunch time, I never even attempted now. Worked late still decent crowd.
Went Steelers vs Ravens playoff game friend NJ. While waiting game start wanted oysters. We looked oyster bar phones low & behold, original Oyster House 0.5 miles away hotel. We happy walked right over. First thing said us was, accept cash. Ok, problem, old fashioned perhaps wanted fresh oysters half shell. Guess what, fresh oysters. We proceeded order fried oysters, fish, onion rings beers. The oysters still frozen middle, fish undercooked onion rings terrible. The beer cold reason got one star. I embarrassed guest idea. I don't recommend want good food. If cold beer want, go it. Otherwise, stay away!
Hubby insisted checking place turned disappointment. I didn't like fish sandwich oysters. 3 stars history behind little space.
Hey oyster house! Do remember me!? I girl came tonight, alone, around 8pm! I camera bag side braid? No, course don't I wasn't acknowledged human being! Apparently single diner don't deserve order taken even seated. I walked tonight wasn't greeted, stood awkwardly door way minutes bar tender asked could help me. I said I'd like table told wait waitress. Still nothing. No one came over. Then I handed menu bar tender sat table. 20 minutes later, nothing. Even family seated immediately next me, waitress took order didn't even look I stared face got point I wave menu around get attention. Nothing. Eventually I enough left, still probably didn't notice. Make sure bring huge group people make mistake eat here, that's way backwards place give respect. If not, you're alone, don't waste 30 minutes without acknowledged like I did.
Don't waste time stopping establishment waitress serving tables rude die dehydration waiting drink bar.
Avoid costs ! The staff rude Ms Piggy ( another customer referred ) refused serve kids dessert drink bar. If go leave disappointed ! I'm surprised lasted month let alone 100 years.
My fiancé lived Pittsburgh year half far worst food service we've living here. We high hopes fresh oysters. When arrived served little plastic Dixie cup shooters flavorless gelatinous. My fiancé like fish sandwhich told server gave regular Pepsi instead diet server rolled eyes stormed off. I recommend restaurant. Please support good food service Pittsburgh elsewhere.
Eh. Food served paper plates. Long wait time initial service drink refills. Just I mind. I won't going back.
This worst pizza I've ever had. We stopped late night snack way back hotel. I got personal pizza, friend got Italian hoagie. One slice pizza, I immediately felt sick. This doesn't generally happen me. I finished slice it. I couldn't eat anymore. She thought hoagie okay, pizza...oh, horror pizza. Avoid.
Average pizza. But ten guys working - much business moment - still took twenty minutes get slice pepperoni. I'll walk across street next time.
This place awful. The pizza good, worse people run place. They screwed order refused fix it. I told I going throw away order somewhere else. And I did. Its really bad, super close apartment. If would've nice switched it, I'd probably order based alone.
Unfortunately dump right street hotel really eaten much day, I hungry. The service terrible....no one knew took 10 minutes get freaking slice pizza said pizza came NASTY. My husband got pizza Milwaukee put Kraft singles cheese Pizza Parma behind worst pizza ever.
I really disturbed, tonight I ordered crab ravioli I kind special cheese culture allergy. Creams totally fine small doses milk too) I ordered ravioli said please cheese it'll make sick." "If there's way order without call I'll change order." The pasta came smelling awful lot like mozzarella) I called asked guy could check order accidentally cheese put it. I mean I get things happen! " The gentleman told didn't know food I look online." Then proceeded say I worried I someone taste snorted I said I dining alone. I'm upset offended. I run business... promote local business's constantly. I sure let everyone know Pizza Parma.. believes customer right, health doesn't matter. What bummer. I used big fan.
Hubby I dropped hellish morning Social Security office. Hubby loves pizza made stop. Pizza wan't bad, actually pretty decent. But place disgusting cashier incredibly rude.
No idea pizza good, website annoying I actually ordered another place. The site plays music option turn sound. I work ready order large meeting, sound distracting appropriate workplace others trying concentrate. Incredibly annoying... Just feedback guys.
Sad say, wasn't pie sky I looking for. It comes crust--I threw out. That never happen. The crust wasn't enough like bread la gourmandine--if bakery made pizza cheese (and even sauce) Angelos...now THAT could potential. So...still shopping around delivery crust bubbles around edges. It might water kneading something?
I really certain place getting stellar reviews has. quick bite last night easily one worst meals I ever pleasure paying for. While people running shop lovely, worth $17 paid. I small cheese steak sub - asking mayo lettuce. would think might nice time let know use sort house garlic-herb mayo instead actual mayo. no. So good bit waiting sub comes weird speckly dressing top lettuce... yes, mayo - disgusting. I thought ranch lady, smile, explained house mayo... no, don't use regular mayo here. so, let tell mayo: 1. heavily flavored garlic powder - tastes seriously like chemicals good day considered food way shape form. Mixed dried herbs - maybe italian mix? knows. I could taste overwhelming chemical, fake garlic flavor. Hey, I love garlic cook daily - mind I actually use real stuff. 2. really thin... I mean thin like salad dressing, runny, thin. Um, isn't mayo supposed thick spreadable? even stuff see subway thicker. stuff tasted like really cheap, bad, ranch dressing. So, giving good effort try eat "sub" - I gave picked bread top sub - bread pretty stellar though. still hungry I decided try scrap mayo/lettuce disaster go meat cheese. um... salt? meat, suspiciously looked like thin sheets steak-um zero flavor. one bite I rejected it. While talking meat - use garbage? I paying almost 6 bucks sub. I want see yummy chopped steak bits like see even mall sub shop. grey, disgusting 1980s looking flavorless "meat". At least bottom sub roll salvageable... I ate bread. On pizza. My husband two slices pepperoni daughter slice plain cheese. Ok, pizza. well, massive disappointment. since I still hungry dumping majority sub I tried pizza slices. reminded nice store-bought frozen pizza. yes, bland. bad sauce flavorless cheese. My husband freak pepperoni pizza two slices almost finished one them. yes, garbage. My daughter? three.. isn't really foodie (yet) got thru cheese pizza... actually spit fair - three. I tried pizza honestly, I could manage somewhat enjoy crust nothing rave tolerable. To provide baseline - typically order Rialto's terrible decent enough sub shop - pizza place. place... ugh. never. again. ever. We ended throwing 80% paid for. This place insults customers sub-par, dated, poor quality food.
I order frame Angelo's regularly .Quality going downhill.First I waited hold 10min ,so I drive I'm still hold,I go there's one person inside orders ..WTF I holding .?...So order $30+ I asked ranch course I pay ?Then I get white pizza home looks like tornado,this seems happening often..and delivery don't get started.My rating PISS POOR!!!
Love home made mayo ranch , But service sucked wait ridiculous! Ordered 4 cuts eat 2 hoagie go.... They served 3 others came us slices gave us ALL food (30 minutes later) ...including go !!! So end go!!!
They get 1 star less option. Was told someone hospital steak hoagies great. Well either opinions differ greatly food got hosed. Looked menu online. $9.00 lrg Angelo special. Think philly cheese steak. So I ordered 2 gf. I asked mine well done peppers onions mushrooms lettuce tomato. I get total $24! So I ask why. I'm told "oh yeah that's owners fault doesn't want update online website it's little date." A LITTLE!?!?? Two half dollars little. So I leave already feeling taken hey big feel heavy I'm still optimistic. WRONG AGAIN! The sandwiches nearly fell grease soaked bag found sandwich covered grease swimming lettuce tomatoes pale mushrooms uncooked peppers. Swimming I tell swimming grease! If I heart atack I'll know why. Called complain pretty much told fault became greasy I took long get there! And owners fault price. Poor food poor excuses apparently poor ownership. The next thing poor owner I NEVER eat again.
Usually don't write review's however love pizza would get family every week, past week pizza same. The crust like usual much sauce. We taking sad break ordering.
Well, stated previous review lunch buffet, finally went dinner, horribly disappointed discover night-and-day comparison lunch dinner. I gnocchi, Veal Imperial, ordered 'traditional style' meant addition $4 came marinated mushrooms, Clams Casino, soup salad. My friend left 1/3 veal dish plate didn't want take home. I took bite, tongue experienced absolutely flavor, extent I take sip iced tea see I getting cold losing sense taste. I could taste tea. I could taste absolutely NOTHING veal. With gnocchi, I ordered sausage, $3 extra, arrived flat sausage patty cut half, tasted like dry sausage McMuffin patty. The salad basic iceberg lettuce veggies. The wedding soup two tiny meatballs 1/3 cup celery. The meal general total disaster, ordered dessert anyway, tiramisu still partially frozen. Then bill came $82. We could believe we'd enjoyed lunch buffet completely, $7.95, dinner, overpriced already was, completely void flavor character. It's baffling comprehend Italian restaurant that's around long would still survive prices total lack quality dinner. We gone high hopes. But honestly, dinner, huge let-down, we'll never go back. We'll go lunch buffet, never dinner. It truly, truly plain sad.
Don't waste time! Oh, I start..? My family friends came Sunday lunch. The prices crazy high (for -cheap- pasta). The menu outside building website doesn't match show table. One guest last one receive perfectly square cheese ravioli filling still frozen! (You'd think $16 ravioli plate you'd get home made). After microwaved barely fit eat. Some flavorless Chicken Piccata, Fish Eggplant Parmigiana. The atmosphere didn't help. The thing aroma place tomato sauce. I don't understand big fuzz make restaurant. What joke!
There pile vomit sidewalk 10 days, For life I cannot believe havent taken care this, turn off. Today 10/3
Another really bad Pittsburgh pizzeria yinzers can't get enough of. Everything place inconvenient. They deliver pretty hard find parking Aggro Crag-esque hill shop sits upon. The interior dirty uninviting...I would even go far call "rapey". After illegally parking 4 ways waiting minutes one employees gave pie I headed home. The pie self real mess. It obvious looking pie whoever made took pride making well, threw everything together plopped oven wing prayer. The dough worst dough I yet Pittsburgh. They using regular deck brick ovens cooking pies directly brick excuse able achieve sort crunch. It dense flavorless crunch all. The taste salt sugar come little bit generic way, almost like Papa Johns tasting dough. The main problem dough obviously didn't rise dense hard chew. Its dry dough too, dry. Plus pizza made poorly middle pie paper thin inedible outside pie way thick hard chew. Basically another bowl-like pizza ingredients pool middle made poorly. It pretty clear wearing pants pizza, good old Uncle Cheese....and pants soaked. I watched kid making one pies filled hands 2 pounds cheese tossed middle pizza kind scattered towards outside said "yeah, do". They using really high quality cheese great taste gummy effect would get ordered extra-cheese. Unfortunately way way much pizza even edible spots. You couldn't even pull slice pie put onto plate without pulling cheese big pile middle. They using lots lots cheese compensate bad best pie sucks. The sauce forgettable watery. They put little sauce pie anyway applied pride traditional lazy bulls-eye pattern sauce spots none others. The sauce bit sweet taste, un-offensive maybe tasty ever put enough anyone taste it. In general lazy pizza would rather give 2 pounds cheese actually take pride food. I feel butt hole starting cry I near end review, save T.P. leave one alone. I giving 4 10.
Zero stars. Came 10 mins close. Female manager duty asked $100 exchange pizza. When refused said could serve us employees working since 9am..,it currently 2:00 am... Sounds pretty illegal
I ordered Pizza Parma storm necessity. I ordered chicken parmigiana "hoagie", dry luke warm. The potato bacon soup like something can, except chunks potato hard undercooked..all pretty nasty overly salty. Never order them.
If I could give zero stars I would. Their pizza horrible begin it's close I live. The Eastern European girl register awful. She tells people pizza half hour they're actually closed. She probably get fired.
They advertise open 2:00 am, 1:00 busy Friday night closed.
The pizza use good. I went last Friday got pepperoni pizza worst pie I ever tasted. Also priced I never come back I people bad !
I used love place, service horrible now. If want something delivered wait 2 hours. Our food ALWAYS wrong. Will coming back.
Have guys daylight? This place filthy! I understand place old, wash curtains (they look like they've flood) glass lamps hanging ceiling. The woodwork floor sticky. We Guinness (in wrong glass I must add) didn't stomach eat anything. All place needs good wash. Let know when, we'll go back.
BAD SERVICE!!! I never Pizzeria driving figured heck, I'm hungry. So I asked two cuts, said would 10 15 minutes. I Shrugged shoulders waited. 15 minutes later I came back, guy oven pulling oven looked guy next said "Shit, I fucked up, supposed cheese" - pepperoni them. I standing right side counter. The boss guy Shrugged shoulders said "Here, look out" threw together another 2 slices cheese put oven said "it's handled." WTF!!?? UH, WHAT ABOUT, OH SORRY, DUDE , OR A FREE CUT!? BAD FKN SERVICE ---- And knew I standing right there!!! I walked woman register said happened slices? AND said "They'll minute." Total cover up. It I could make scene. Fuck I don't need disrespected like that. I'm going stand argue like asshole... I never ever eat --- pizza mediocre.
A couple small TVs, three page list craft beers. Is one enjoys Steelers game? I suspect you're type needs take refuge pro sports, place might oasis. In search something resembling vegetable Pittsburgh, deep fried pickles. Quite okay. Quite decent Reuben sandwich. Would like see better beer selection. One places open strip district 5 pm.
For first time life, I sent meal back kitchen. The Corn Beef Corn Beef Cabbage tasted really bad felt like I chewing gum. Avoid plate costs
Group us went Saturday afternoon. Service good. We ordered 3 apps: fried green beans, bread cheese plate (with apple chutney spread) flat bread crab artichoke. All tasty. My girlfriend I ordered shepherd's pie. Both satisfied. My mother ordered chicken tenders (again). They fine. My uncle's girlfriend's chicken salad fruit plate. She enjoyed it. My uncle big problems fish chips. He said fish greasy batter oily texture it. Not good all. Overall, consensus we'd go back.
I numerous bad experiences Mullaneys Harp Fiddle now. It one block I work I go convenience. I usually get steak salad used good. The last 4 times getting it, I issues. One time nice full meal times looks like kids salad $13, isn't worth it. Last time I went take out, bill $13 change. I gave bartender $15 received $1 back. She decided keep rest change acted like owed her. I didn't say anything bothered would assume could change. Today, even though I said I wouldn't go again, I craving salad little time lunch. I asked medium cooked steak BEYOND well done. It actually crispy. The French fries top rock hard burnt seems recooked yesterday. I cannot eat this. I certainly walk extra blocks get food prepared properly. Never me.
This first negative review I've written needs done save anyone may thinking eating miserable experience. To begin, stopped wasn't busy...early afternoon..so surprised dirty unkept was. Sticky floors, bad smell, general lack housekeeping. The bartender nice cordial positive thing I say. The Sheppard's Pie aweful. Overly buttery instant potatoes, much cheap chedder cheese, worst quality greasy ground hamburger canned crunchy onions (on Shepard's Pie?). I ate less half debating I allow dogs eat rest throw away. The potato soup salty I chugged water afterwards feel relief. I physically Illl grease butter. I mean literally. The thing Irish place name Guiness tap. Other ill mannered intoxicated uncultured college student one like place. I better experiences Giant Eagle hot food counter. Sorry guys got better ever think ill return.
Wanted like place haven't explored strip district touristy feel crowds..wanted explore different areas city. The fish kind slimey didn't good taste. The fries really hard cooked potato within them. The Shephard pie instant mashed potato taste crumbled hamburger plain cheddar cheese top small shreds carrot. Not much better KFC bowl onion rings frozen food variety. Not sure people like much. If drinking wouldn't care. Maybe bad day. I would recommend paying attention cook times get rid fish. Maybe use fresh store made ingredients Shephard's pie
Kraynick's real gem Pittsburgh. This isn't place take high-end carbon frame bike, Jerry help get commuter, beater, frame found trashed ditch woods back road. (Seriously, guy salvaging old MTB frame found ditch woods.) Be forewarned: he's pretty typical lot old school Pittsburghers: gruff first, actually nice guy warms you. I haven't bike ten years decided nowhere build one around old frame new internal gear hub. I bought high-end components online rest Jerry. Despite bringing outside parts, Jerry still gushing help, and, several weeks 3-4 visits, I'm riding bike I built scratch going mechanical knowledge bikes all. He doesn't carry new super-high-end components, stuff carry solid, every weird bracket screw cable guide imagine decades scrounging parts. He help weird setup want. (Mine's definitely out-of-the-ordinary.) One warning: standard old Pittsburgh small business, doesn't take credit cards. It's little annoying considering might spending $100 parts service, there's ATM block.
Moved Strip tried food group four. The Shepard's Pie awful...I sure meat flavor odd. One person tried would eat it. The fish n chips good. The fries soggy soft, fish mediocre. VERY DISAPPOINTED. AND IT WAS NOT CHEAP!!! Will go eat again!
If you're going grab Starbucks, far favorite one nearest trifecta locations (6th, Liberty, Market Square). Generally speaking, Starbucks staff pleasure deal with, I think particular location tops nearby. One reasons likely don't seem quite hectic locations opt drop (usually afternoon). Don't get wrong, it's busy, nearly bad 6th Market Square. It's also cleanest three. It also least amount seating, though, pick battles, I guess. This doesn't seem like high merch volume shop, don't expect walk see vast array coffee mug options anything, otherwise it's standard Starbucks fast service, nice staff, predictably unpredictable Starbucks beverages.
This place feels like home - home built tires bolts lots unidentifiable bicycle parts. My first visit Kraynick's panic situation, otherwise known tire blow-out. Having commuted work daily bike 3+ years, I've strangely immune things like flats, blowouts, really anything sort. So happened, I clue do. I thought visiting Performance Bike East Liberty, I purchased current ride, lure Kraynick's much. Plus, I able leave work 10 minutes early actually get 6pm closing time. With busted tire one hand, I pushed door open greeted - well, I'm really sure describe it. An avalanche perhaps, bicycle parts EVERYWHERE. Seriously, hanging every nook cranny; taking every inch counter space; even occupying step stairs near front door (at least I think stairs...). I'm pretty sure I stood awe minute taking hesitant steps inside. I'd read enough reviews know white-haired man Jerry. I waited minutes Jerry finished customer sort presented tire smile look said "please don't judge knowing this." No judgement. Jerry told dangerous blowout hoped I hadn't going fast. Then plucked identical tire ceiling rack head asked I needed anything else. I rocked back forth heels times sheepishly asking could tell change tire I returned home. In, I swear, less 10 words, explained process wished luck. For $20 I bought tire, tube the, um, things use take tire off...tire irons? I'll take class someday. Seriously. Aaaanyway. I returned shop earlier week tire, experiencing annoying slow leak. Jerry told tube offered tools "the back" I could quick change. Well, front room filled brim every part cycle sun, back room equally bursting every tool imaginable; none I knew use. With kind help guys working bikes, I managed change tube time, leaving shop kind silly sense accomplishment incredibly black hands.
There's reason place reviews. It's never open...not even 6:30 pm Thursday. Even though sign said "Open" door open. I guess I supposed know closed. But I got two people screaming ear closed like I barely understood something. So much customer service. Needless say, I probably won't back.
son inherited crap bike friend. wary.. took kraynick's $15, got breaks, tire, chain instruction fix everything himself. fantastic place!
Uggh. I wanted pho really bad, tastes like warm ramen broth 4 little pieces meat it. Got fried spring rolls, too, charged $5-6 four little rolls obviously prepackaged frozen spring rolls. I gotta stop trying restaurants without checking Yelp first, everyone else dead on. Avoid place unless you're Strip absolutely Vietnamese (and don't care much quality).
If wasn't Chicken Hoagies (Banh-Mi Ga) sell outside Saturday Sunday Mornings(This time I think get it)...I wouldn't even bother wanting revisit experience place. So day craving Banh-Mi Ga, stand outside selling Banh-Mi. We decided go see sold Banh-Mi inside. The waiter told us lady sells Banh-Mi sell Banh-Mi outside. The Restaurant Kitchen make them. So ordered Pho Vermicelli...BIG MISTAKE! How possible make something supposed taste SOOO Good...Taste SOOO BAD? My Ngoc knows answer. GIVING THREE STARS BANH-MI....BUT....DON'T GO INSIDE! BE WARNED!
Do go inside! sandwich lady outside place back away... said, everyday 3pm. chicken, pork, vegi. $5. worth it. made pine San Francisco there's Vietnamese sandwich place every corner, almost.
My Ngoc apparent makeover currently new management. The claim reputation though Lucy Sheets used sell banh mi outside store. Banh mi Vietnamese sandwich French baguette sort meat filling, pickled carrots daikon, cilantro, jalapenos, mayo. Traditionally also pate, ones My Ngoc don't it. Unfortunately, new owner informed Lucy moved set shop NYC. However, still sell tasty roast pork chicken banh mi. A warm French baguette filled meat choice topped tasty ingredients. The heat jalapenos cooled pickled vegetables mayo helps bring ingredients together. By Pittsburgh standards, it's worthy 4 stars easy. On hand, pho much room improvement. The broth wasn't savory flavorful I've elsewhere noodles bit tougher side. A banh mi run $5-$6, definitely pricier side given it's size, niche food small market, I'm definitely complaining I need banh mi fix. For pho though, I'd head elsewhere now.
Quick, helpful, extremely affordable. I can't believe I lived street place four years without stepping foot inside! It treasure.
I huge fan shopping off-price places like Filene's, TJ Maxx, Marshall's, Burlington Coat Factory. Yeah there's lot crap. Yeah, there's lot stuff picked over. But every often, I find one item I've looking for. I recently bought nice Polo knit shirt husband one tell I didn't buy Macy's. I like location it's Downtown I shop lunch hour.
So here's story, I went branch Burlington Coat factory Saturday morning I town conference. It 10:15 I panel 10:30 (so I hurry). I needed get pair jeans ones I packed damaged. I found I looking I left dressing room (wearing item-which I done stores--with problem), I told woman I would pay register (keep mind I person store). SHE WAS AGAST! She couldn't believe I said that. She said I absolutely pay jeans I could wear them. Keep mind I've travel wear clothes store paid HAVE HAD NO PROBLEMS. I FEEL LIKE SHE TREATED ME LIKE A CRIMINAL. I deeply insulted. I remember I don't go Burlington Coat Factory.
Pretty darn yummy etc. Wings Kill for, least poke eyes for.
Stopped lunch today little shopping. Found cute little sundress 60% retail price. Found shirt husband Rick looking too. So yeah, coming always gamble you've gotta sift lot. But occasionally find something.
I ordered Veggie Pizza 4 different toppings really enjoy lot. They use oil smell different killed taste pizza. Also, toppings greatly blended, rather sprinkled. DIdn't even enjoy pizza crust. I work right next door, wont go again. I usually dont write reviews. Was surprised Yelp 4 stars I disaoopinted, writing experience.So sharing input may help others make uinformed choice causeI think 4 stars misleading.
This single worst Thai meal I ever life. I went dinner friends going PSO, since open relatively late night. This proved massive error judgement parts. The first thing I ordered bowl lemongrass soup. The listing ingredients made seem like tom yum soup, one favorite soups. What I received bowl dishwater-colored broth containing tomatoes, tasted like watered-down minestrone, chicken submerged shame bottom bowl. A single lonely wilted leaf cilantro wallowed top. No lemongrass evidence, plenty mushrooms. I stopped eating I unearthed unsightly artifact turned bottom mushroom stem, dirt still clinging it. My companions got chicken stir-fried vegetables turned Singapore curry sauce. This passable, exciting -- again, although claimed lemongrassy, lemongrass flavor had, chicken bit rubbery overdone. I got one fish entrees. On menu, description made like covered spicy sauce. It turned like not-at-all-spicy soup bits orange roughy floating it. Again, broth lacking overall flavor, trying save costs adding enough spices. The fish least overcooked dirty, poor aesthetic decision bread fry piece fish, put breaded coating soup. Gross. To top off, service wasn't great, actually charged dirt-filled soup. We back.
I saw employees throw firecrackers people walking by. Not sure else I need say...I give one star bc app clearly I would give zero.
terrible service right. minute coworker walked in, host (i think teenage son owner?) rude. going give us table closest register people always walking out. coworker asked seated one 8 tables open. mumbled something, let us grab another table. served dishes pretty much throwing onto table. wonton soup horrible. wonton pretty much dough (not even cooked way thru) don't even want speculate tiny meat made of. i've also tried house soup water tomotoes it. entree green curry w/chicken, actually wasn't bad service that's saying much all. sad one places asian food pitts...
At last! An old-timey barbershop honest-to-God barbers know cut men's hair. The barbers business (never engaging annoying, small talk b.s. endure chains), they're still totally friendly. If want chat, they'll chat, want silent haircut, they're game that, too. The environment also kicky: wooden floors, classic leather barber chairs, pastiche posters - gentle reminder "better days". Even Fox News channel that's endless, nattering loop seems like puppy dog charming vibe Cercone's. Gentlemen: go Supercuts when, much less, get real deal?
Visiting Pittsburgh daughter, wanted eat somewhere downtown walk far. Yelped place chose close rating. But turns generally trust fellow yelpers one. We seated immediately wasn't crowded (bad sign). We sat window. The best thing restaurant decor, Thai motif wall, glass case little Thai statues, nice vase fake orchid table. nicely folded cloth napkin...etc, I didn't experience bad service others claimed, I see might possible service quite mediocre. Now segway food I don't know explain this, bad service inadequate food, ordered beef curry, came NO BEEF it. Did think could get away wouldn't notice? I figured oversight , maybe looked like vegetarians, it's ridiculous restaurant skimp food. But I got chicken lemongrass soup. It tiny hardly chicken it. I wanted typical Thai soup called Tom Kha Gai never heard it. But please take look photos see small soup bowl is. I placed spoon top comparison really see bowl much bigger spoon. Nuff said.
Really cheap, & really quick! As mentioned before, barbers listen & cut hair way ask them. Only drawback, see such, specialize traditional cuts (buzz cut, crew cut, etc). Nothing edgy crazy This cash place, don't forget $10!
Waiter awful food (pad thai) much better. Apparently letting waiter know soda flat (twice) huge inconvenience him.
Waited 20 minutes two glasses wine. When came filthy point covered lipstick. I'll never try food here.
don't really remember food definitely remember mice (yes 2) saw dining room! awkward considering first date. service polite nice never went back issue. year ago today, guess rated saw yelp list.
I shocked poor food quality service restaurant. It looks like bar tables server black biking spandex sweatshirt. Not exactly 'Fine Dining' like sign window claims certainly overpriced menu. The drinks took forever, I something floating wine. The soup tasted spoiled, tomatoes salad frozen mushy. We ordered bruschetta got three pieces arranged white loaf bread couple tomatoes olive oil drizzled center. The restroom sink black hair it, toilet wasn't anchored down! This place TRASHY. Complete nightmare. Total dive bar awful food service. The server reminded numerous times bring check us, kept roaming away. Neither us touched dinner, afraid eat it. Diners beware, spend money elsewhere.
This review banquet room regular menu. I came communion party place hold occasion. There definitely family feel here. Food served buffet style, servers place food plates, I thought nice. Taste-wise, food delicious. On menu baked chicken, penne pasta, meatballs, fried zucchini, potato balls, salad bread. Chicken moist well-seasoned. Meatballs also moist flavorful. My favorites fried zucchini potato balls. The potato balls pieces potato, breaded fried. They soft inside crispy outside. I'm definitely curious regular menu definitely plan coming back! Service also great. The servers served food buffet trays also cleared empty plates way quickly. The reason docking one star dark there! The restaurant's outdated brown decor didn't brighten anything either. I suppose makes place feel like you're nana's house something, darkness made feel little depressing.
The burger good can't say anything bad it. You disappointed, unless like fries burger. If case better look elsewhere. Not fry found I find home fries poor substitute burger. Just two cents.
I also left scratching head lofty reviews place. Yes, maybe local institution, worthy one highest yelp ratings restaurant Pittsburgh. The burger mildly admirable. I'll trust word use high quality ground beef, it's still ground "beef", ground sirloin anything. It also huge, cumbersome, greasy, expensive flavorless. The amount blue cheese gave 50c almost joke, well. Wish I would gotten steamed broccoli, "potato salad" sea mayonnaise. Even given limited experience burger options Pittsburgh, I would put double-wide grill's burger these. Not much atmosphere. Don't get wrong, I don't mind dirty, dark dingy character.
I've better burgers several Pittsburgh restaurants. I never eaten anything else Tessaro menu--and since doesn't look appealing, it's likely I will--but burgers OK. The service, opinion, often quite rude. The "ambiance" loud, dark, dingy depressing. Sorry, I don't get it. For better hamburger, try Sharp Edge Beer Emporium, Murray Avenue Grill, even Five Guys Burgers Fries.
This place hyped end burgers. It may may be, food actually quite decent- I've burgers seafood chicken salads years. The reason I rate place low atmosphere abysmal. I've always felt like outsider here, even going twice week months. (We live right street.) The hosts terrible - it's like look right past you're one Special Friends shoehorn tiny uncomfortable booths putting smaller parties comfortable spacious booths. I'll go street Lot 17, food better one makes show "Member's Card" get seated.
Usually I think burger, I think mediocre meat lots toppings mask crappy meat. Fits craving sometimes, spectacular meal. Tessaro's defined burger eating experience unlike other. The meat use awesome, texture taste. I always order medium-rare. If there's one place I'd take out-of-town friends eat, would here.
Never treated poorly I went three friends eat Tessaro's rainy Saturday evening. I dropped I parked car. The hostess sat found I parking car, told literally "GET UP." She said wouldn't seat I wasn't there. By time I arrived table friends still shock utter rudeness. Tessaro's Pittsburgh institution family frequented years. Our treatment disgrace reputation
Overrated. No seating members party arrived...so awkwardly hovered empty tables. The second bummer lack french fries - borderline criminal offer burger. The bun dry, burger ok, generous portion meat though. Nothing special here. crowd un-diverse get. sure hype about.
While place isn't lot look (we sat bar), hamburgers Tessaro's live hype. They thick juicy little bit char outside. You get whatever want one I got mine side potato salad. Perhaps I seeking comfort previous day's Steeler Super Bowl defeat, I ate burger fast I bit lip least twice process. Damn Tasty! Would go back, especially since it's street sister's place da 'Burgh.
I've coming past 10 years always enjoyed food atmosphere, I'm sad write review speaks poorly place. Having said that, last experience Tessaro's ruined even seated. While waiting girlfriend seated 25 minutes, party 3 walks immediately seated. When I ask party 3 would seated many parties 2 waiting I told seating laid specifically accommodate specific number people: absurd! We proceed wait another 15 minutes 2 top opened up. I would gladly recommend place food, given inefficient seating system I'd go seated right away.
Tessaro's serves mean burger, I think thing order go though I seen people eat things. Totally laid back atmosphere relax bring kids. The tables covered denim cloth, enough said. My favorite bacon bleu burger (dry bleu cheese) potato salad. Burger cooked perfection juicy I cut burger half tackle make mess. You find eating every bite. If come peak dinner hours likely waiting, I would make sure NOT come Sunday since opened (whoops).
burger really dry tasteless, I ordered cooked medium. I disappointed place everyone says best burger town...I must missing something. I thought atmosphere kinda sucks way seating done leaves much desired...overall might go back see fluke, wont rushing there.
So everyone always raves place infamous burger joint bloomfield, I try it...and I listened capricorn perfectionist gf right said overrated. We got burgers...I got bbq got bleu. The burgers tasted like one part oxygen 1 part hydrogen. At least soup good...and waitress didnt know properly place salt n pepper shakers....salt right(for blind).... Another negative place people sit close you, like mad mex. It takes away privacy, I wanted talk baby fetuses couldnt
Never understood hype place. The burgers rather bland burnt. No fries, potato things NOT good fry I ever had. And wait always ridiculous boot. I admittedly haven't years, doesn't seem like type place would changed.
In theory, Tessaro's exactly want -- casual neighborhood joint great location acclaimed product. In practice, it's pleasant go there. I don't think want us there. Every interaction seems designed make people feel awkward. The burger -- actual cooked meat -- indeed good, interest stuff turns cooked meat hamburger experience. The buns poor quality; absorb juices toppings get sloppy disgusting bites. The burger falls apart hands (or onto lap). You finish fork. They don't serve French fries, seem affronted ask some. This bizarre, given everything else place screams "we fries here!" Why withhold fries customers surely asking every day years? This hints either weird purist dogmatic sensibility, deliberate sabotage. Why serve fries *and* homefries? Are afraid fries win, exposing hollow sham homefries along? I've come believe everyone Tessaro's spell must cook serve excellent hamburgers, hate cooking serving hamburgers. Everything restaurant actual meat patty cleverly designed keep away. But keep going back. Have pity poor cursed Tessaro workers, go street BRGR, downtown Winghart's.
Came Monday night October sat bar. This dive joint quintessential Pittsburgh blue collar neighborhood. Had cheeseburger potato salad great. Will defer others "best burger" argument. Only complaint lack appetizers menu (e.g., wings). And don't offer fries? I mean potato salad ok, like fries burgers. btw...knew I Pittsburgh turned NFL MNF game regular season Colorado-Toronto hockey game (ie., even Penguins). Let's say like hockey town. Very weird!!!
With Pittsburghers talk Tessaro's, you'd think it's epitome excellent all-American food. But four times, I really say it's meh Pittsburgh. I apologize bland, boring, generic tone rest review, I'm sure else describe food here... The portion 'American' burger really thick juicy I expected done medium. As BIG burgers I like cut half it's manageable...and I still seem somewhat ladylike. The first half burger OK/good/no complaints. The second half seemed lack flavor... I guess first half I hungry, calm taste order, bland. I mean course I could taste mayo/ketchup/mustard, actual meat part flavorless. I really disappointed that... I ordered potato salad side good/OK too...nothing call home about. In honesty I would've rather Five Guys In-n-Out burgers.
I heard good amount positive reviews place lots different people. That said, I expecting wowed burgers, reason people told go. However, I arrived guest, 8:00 PM Thursday night, I kind disappointed. Not waitress take good 10 minutes brought us water, attentive never checked back us brought bill. The burger so-so little flavor, disappointing. I could also tell tables section looking around waiting server. All all, I disappointed quality food well service.
You hear place years finally get chance try it's bound live expectations? That experience Tessaro's. Had I never heard before, may gotten extra star. But, restaurant Pittsburgh's top 25 years back. This supposed best burgers 'burgh. If case, I'd stick making own. Hubs I stopped T's recent Friday night conducting business area. Baby board, walked waited greeted. The inside looked bit old run down. Tip: highchairs booster seats impossible get squirmy baby stay in. I would suggest bringing baby here. The tables also small close together. We actually move table get corner booth. I decided basic cheeseburger ordered boiled red skin potatoes baby side chips fully expecting homemade chips. Not case. I got handful seemed ruffles knock off. The potatoes bland despite served warm butter side. Great picky baby. Bad adult looking something tasty. Now burger. Huge, yes. Juicy, even close. Despite ordering burgers well done, I expect still tender juicy. This case. My burger dry burnt piece chicken. I ate half it. We bit hurry I didn't mention server, though I'm sure would made difference seeing hubs medium burger also dry. Overall, Tessaro's fell flat left hung dry.
This burger place I ever doesn't serve french fries. WTF? Went once, due bad weather, would never go again.
Out 5: 3.5 - Burger: The first several times I came here, terribly overcooked dry. Then, sudden, quality consistency cooking went significantly. While lacks seasoning, getting sprinkle salt pepper cook works wonders. 3.0 - Cajun Burger: Now that's seasoning. A bit strong salty good every while. 1.5 - Home Fries 2.5 - Red Skin Potatoes: glad see slightly healthier yet healthy side dishes here. Though melted butter... 3.0 - Beef Ribs 0.5 - swordfish: dry tough 2.5 - tuna 1.5 - Service: Can quite bad lot times, probably busy are. 2.0 - Value
After getting one "famous" burgers, I really don't understand hype. Mediocre food mediocre service.
4 us came dinner ordered burgers drinks. The pino Grigio tasted bitter complained waitress acted like bothering saying anything kept trying walk away. She came table 2 times two hours. Bad customer service honest bad service around.
Horrible Food, Horrendous Customer Service, #overrated So I already wasted 2 hours life eating place, I going write thesis someone patron restaurant. In summation, arrived harassed owner (acting hostess) wanting sit corner, served flat beer, interrogated sending order back meeting clear specifications given waitress. Living Latin America traveling Asia time, I lot hellholes, hands worst place I ever been. Not food lousy way overpriced, hassled belligerent, sarcastic, condescending owner almost entire time. Clearly, customer service quality food valued. Honestly, I would rather starve eat again.
Went second time busy Friday night 45 minute wait table. The wait unexpected, expected order drinks pass time. However, bar tenders unenthusiastic serving drinks us. The two bar tenders made us feel like putting out. While waiting, told stand rear coat rack area. There ten wooden posts coats posts rail inch thick line dust. The dust doesn't end there. We sat booth front place ceiling fan old phone. The phone us wall covered cobwebs dust. Each ceiling fan blades covered dust dust dirt thick dripping sides waiting fall plates. The food: average. Most us burgers. One us open face steak sandwich. The steak charred seasoned. One us felt one burgers. 6 us plus drinks $160.00. This place needs closed days deep cleaning. If don't care cleanliness dining room, surely don't care safe food prep.
As local Pittsburgher I've eaten many times. I say I've Never bad meal bad experience way. I highly recommend .
WORST service seating EVER! We standing little doorway hour seated. And old seating lady wore tons bracelet messed seating list (basically seated whoever wanted seat). Food ok service thumb down. I would never come back.
Ordered usual Roberta salad. It's hidden item menu know about. It's salad rotini pasta grilled. Broccoli cauliflower grilled onions mushrooms. All topped steak chicken. I usually go med rare steak. You get small large. My complaint veggies oily. I'll make sure ask steamed veggies oil. Other wife exact meal. Service always good friendly. And new deck going regular spot!!
Not better burger anywhere - Galaxy wide. Long time customer - I burgh - I quickly head towards Tessaro's! RIP Kelly.
terrible service. quality food gone downhill
still favorite place get burger city Pittsburgh, it's atmosphere bar servers bartenders everybody inside works makes worth going food drinks, even w/ changes last years Tessaro's business long time ago kept it. Bacon blue burger, medium, w/a Guinness steamed veggies - usual
The burger decent. Not best Pittsburgh like lot people say. The steak salad really big, steak cooked perfectly, complaints there. The tables kinda small, feel little cramped there... wait that's common thing Pittsburgh I'm slowly discovering. Overall bad. No real complaints.
Arrived late Pittsburgh quaint little neighborhood joint. The burgers weren't bad - I ordered steak burger waitress recommended, unless teeth like steak knives, wasn't easiest thing eat. Flavors good, job late night I needed find something. Nice people, too!
The staff pretty awful, unrepentant, nasty homophobes. Every level steak doneness means "burnt". If like either things, sure visit Tessaro's, I so.
The burgers big delicious I actually get three meals them. Sometimes take granted living street glad I do. Something kinda weird happened couple years ago: waitress taking us back table accidentally knocked small trash front restaurant. She used menus scoop trash back in. This first time friend there. Needless say little skeptical eating seeing that. No worries though he's back ton times.
It seems place hit miss. I've gone amazing service, times terrible service. The food went amazing mediocre without missing beat. The burgers huge, doubt that. No matter I order it, I receive burnt charred burger tastes grill. I tried steak instead thr next time went. Even worse, seasoning whatsoever. It's close I live work I stop time time everything else closed. The newly remolded area nice quiet that's plus. Would I recommend it? Probably not. Will I return? Inevitably.
Update: I new agent now. When plans got switched come office go policies make sure correct I understood them. Turns out, Grace Robinson bad customer service, policies I agreed (when I moved Pitt SC I asked write auto policy exact same, I meant deductibles, auto policy SC, I come find isn't even close same!!!) AND, The umbrella policy still incorrect (they needed coordinate SC didn't). I glad rid them! I recommend anyone goes want insurance actually cover think covers!!! How scary find deductibles coverages aren't agreed to?? What I gotten wreck?
I've ever small things (very small) done (inspection, oil change, etc) - always super friendly efficient.
Top list late lunch today. While attending Italian festival Bloomfield last September I tried polenta meatballs, meatball sandwhich! I love meatballs ones well seasoned, juicy, soaked great marinara sauce. I occasionally get cravings meatballs today day. A couple months ago I tried go Sunday closed. It cold, snowy Sunday I thought closed I showed pretty late plus bad weather. I attempted go today dismay always closed Sundays I would seen I checked yelp app. BOOO! Three stars far... great meatballs! Points lost closed Sundays. Who closed Sundays?? Crucial Lazy Sunday dining revenue squandered! They must busy enough don't need extra business day. Wait update I'LL BE BACK!
Well honest one worst dinning experiences eating career. We sat outside service VERY SLOW. Then purse gets stolen right hand I describe gang thugs. As wasn't bad enough slow wait staff took ten minutes call police proceeded charge us mediocre meals even saw telling police wallet stolen waitstaffs watchful eye. Save money wallet go wendy's quality far superior place.
I really good food past (try eggplant rolatini) local bread fantastic. Tonight, however, awful. Linguini Alfredo supposed "homemade" far cry simple butter/cream/parmesan classic recipe. It way thick absolutely tasteless. Also, diet coke tasted funny lack carbonation. My nephew ordered grilled cheese I thought would use local Sancholi bread, no. ;(. It tasted like yellow spray use grills. The waitress didn't take coke bill I asked. I think restaurant staple neighborhood. I hope experience tonight isn't repeated.
Some friends I Friday, August 22nd. It crowded due Little Italy Days Bloomfield. I didn't mind waiting 45 minutes table busy, seemed really understaffed strange since Little Italy Days. Once seated, waited 15 minutes waitress Misty greet us take drink orders. She complained busy second double row working. She told us thinking getting wasted night coming next day hungover... I stand waitresses/waiters see we're younger (I'm 25, friends early 30s) assume drop professionalism talk us like we're friends. I sympathize slammed I don't want hear complaining I want hear getting wasted. We requested another waitress moment. Two tables seated 10-15 minutes us got food 20 minutes us. Two waitresses working room seemed fast competent. We table Misty, working bar area us. She never checked us, took forever get food us (which I'm assuming sitting back kitchen quite time) finished, sat 20 minutes finally flagged hostess check. From time walked time walked little 2 hours. Would never consider going back. The food good.
This place good italian sauce tasted like chef boyardee crab cakes cooked middle cold. I wont back.
My daughter, sisrer, nephew, I mood Italian food decided give pleasure bar try. We arrived 7:20pm told would 20 30- minute wait; finally got table almost hour. Over course next 90 minutes received bread, cabbage water little meatballs, one odd- smelling cloudy iced tea, numerous claims food would "right out". After two-and half hour bout frustration enough went home hungry. I never go again. The little bit food awful, never got entrees. Yelp need zero rating places like this.
Awful. Just awful. My boyfriend I went dinner last Saturday. We craving Italian agreed try somewhere Pittsburghs little Italy. We looked around Bloomfield decided place. With menu boasting Italian favorites, thought would great. Nope. He ordered veal parmigiana I got seafood Alfredo. His entree came wedding soup ok...but server brought it, crackers fell worn, dirty carpet picked put table...gross. Our food took forever got I highly disappointed. My Alfredo tasteless. No salt cheese, bland béchamel. The shrimp clearly previously frozen well "scallops" tiny rubbery. The veal soggy chewy sauce sub par. We tried push couldn't. We turned around saw dated less clean looking decor, didn't. We never back I would NEVER recommend place anyone!
Took nearly two hours everyone party get food. Food cold arrived.
This really disappointing. I went three others Friday night grab dinner. Unfortunately, pretty underwhelmed dinner. I'll open highlights. The potato balls yummy. Crispy outside, creamy cheesy inside. There easily highlight meal. Also desserts good. We chocolate cake, tiramisu lemon berry mascarpone cake. The desserts flavorful, sweet yummy. The entrees, however, left much desired. The table order penne Alfredo, penne malfalda, putenesca. I ordered amanda pasta, special. It sauteed broccoli, zuchinni sundried tomatoes aglio olio sauce. Everything tasted like nothing. I'm positive pasta water wasn't salted. Even putanesca, didn't include tomatoes, seasoning, seems like impossible feat considering historically salty dish. Everything bland disappointing. It literally tasted like place given up. I likely won't go back, except maybe dessert, even then, won't time soon.
Pasta watery limp. The noodles practically swimming pool warm water.... Presentation taste food mediocre. While food reminded home cooked meals, pricier I would pay "homey" meals. I returning. People seemed fun bar area, I would return Italian food.
Take quart wedding soup home you. There little Italian mama back making sauce. Traditional Italian cooking .... know lunch tomorrow. ... leftovers dinner ... huge portions. I took 300 lb football player (lean mean fighting machine) dinner couldn't finish lasagna ... it's big. [Parking open metered lot behind restaurant ... people walk dogs sidewalk lot ... watch step ... always pile.]
1 star food, GROSS! 5 stars plate glass window people watching!!!
My boyfriend I came another couple weeks back round birthday drinks. Kyle heard good things Pleasure Bar several people, anxious try it. It Friday night around 11:30 first stop night, nobody group intoxicated either appearance reality. (This becomes important later.) We walked greeted rowdy group three men hitting female couple nearby playing lots country music jukebox. So far standard bar behavior certain demographic nothing concerned about. There one lone female bartender seemed sweet enough. One friend ordered Blue Moon Yuengling. The Blue Moon seemed super overpriced, boyfriend I undeterred ordered two Dogfish Head IPAs. Score! They significantly cheaper. (I love whoever bar buys beer least.) Around half hour later friends wanted round whiskey shots ordered two. They handed bartender $20 told intention leave immediately after. They received two shots nothing more. We waited fifteen minutes, shots consumed, etc. Everyone thinking hmmm $10 shots, pricey okay...it felt odd going roll boyfriend stepped politely asked change coming. The bartender smiled, turned heel, went back register produced change owed. (I believe $7 total.) I two problems way things run Pleasure Bar. One, bartender horribly harassed group men next us. (As screaming her, calling bar wench, using sexually derogatory language.) I saw one female staff member floating around somewhere back, overall seemed deserted. I felt terrible situation. Two, giving polite patrons change understandable crazy busy nights packed bars, situation felt suspiciously like she'd planned pocketing change I don't think that's professional. The bar capacity forty people eight nine individuals deal with. Nobody else even ordered drinks there. With behavior group I could see upset simply forgot change, I mentally tried give benefit doubt still seemed pretty off. We already tipped generously first round, reason assume wouldn't shots. If I ever come back I know I'll watching change lot closely!
I feel like it's kind hit miss regard food. There times I've food good I'd felt like I inhaling it. Other times it's bland boring.
Con: Completely disregarded request. The barber could even cut straight fade. This barbers 'method' cutting back hair going across perpendicularly. Out respect mans age, I paid $12 left.. Pro: hair grows back quickly.
If rating sandwiches whole pizzas, would definitely five stars way. However single slices horrible. I thought would heat slices sit heater area. I asked extra sauce, thinking slices heated. I given slice pizza cold sauce.
Basic pizza. Pretty solid, expensive open till 11:00 weeknights. Really much complain about.
So, I recently (and finally) got dentist here, decided go Pretaglia close place. I've twice, wait I've times incredibly long unnecessary. Once, I person wait room almost half hour. Second, place old, stuffy, decor archaic. Petraglia's bedside manner great, hardly shaking hand getting mouth. Both visits little dentist/patient time- I wonder wait long. Furthermore, sent home cheapest toothbrush paste possible, highly ironic dentist's office preaches upscale products betterment teeth gums. Knowledgeable enough, I think lot learn making patients feel welcomed place looks like it's actually 21st century.
I've going Dr. Petraglia's office years now. The staff professional Dr. Petraglia knows he's doing. The inside office dated previous reviews mentioned, that's big deal me. About two years ago, I developed ulcers gums (too much acidic foods/drinks) caused discomfort. Dr. Petraglia gave sample size something (I don't remember tge name it) apply affected area. It helped tremendously. Thankfully, prescription wasn't needed I cut back lemon water - culprit. Only metered street parking available. For routine cleaning, I'm one half hour, 45 minutes. To celebrate cavities, I bought two cookies Paddy Cake Bakery, block. Review come...
Two words: Chicken Mango. There nothing like Indian restaurant I've since. Other dish, Peoples pretty typical small Indian restaurants. The buffet alright, portions average size service reasonably good.
I disappointed. I lived neighborhood 6 years I keep giving second chance (and third). The take menu says big letter front 15% take out. So ordered again, although generally get poor service food average best. This time ordered 2 entrees sides. When I went pick order given us 15% ONE ENTREE. So discount all. When mention something poorly worded menu principle false advertising argue you. So done them, peoples drive Taste India on.
This far worst Thai restaurant I've ever to. The servers rude slow, food awful. Everything pretty much looks tastes same. The waiter seemed annoyed eating partner complained soda flat, brought another flat soda. When complained again, waiter told see host way out. If area, many better choices good meal, place.
Just panang tofu lunch, crazy underwhelmed. Tiny portion, watery sauce, *zing* flavor. The wait staff slammed half-full restaurant, things like coke took ten fifteen minutes. This trip bad, even price.
A friend mine I thought would meet lunch one Wednesday. I'm fan Thai food I thought would give Lemon Grass Cafe try. We arrived little noon seated promptly. That best part experience. It took hour receive food. AN HOUR busy Wednesday lunch break. There sorry, we're working ... etc. No explanation given. The food meh. I've much better. I would recommend place anyone. As walking lady waiting takeout order, called ahead about. And wasn't ready yet waiting 20 minutes it. Terrible terrible customer service.
Stay away!!!!!! The waiters/waitresses hate hapiness.
Poor service, awful attitudes sub-par food. I could make food kitchen ... Hope see another Thai spot open downtown.
I would say Lemongrass ok, great. I've Panang curry times really enjoyed it. The Green curry also decent. What brings Lemongrass incredibly slow service. Whether it's busy time slow time, it's slow slow slow. One waiter entire restaurant that's it. The atmosphere ambiance restaurant nice. And given price, it's bad lunch spot.
Oh place needs Gordon Ramsay, Friendly staff, something missing I don't know what? Food ok, fab. I little disappointed Panang curry didn't look like I know look tasted like. Thai tea bueno.
This restaurant never great, wanted Asian restaurant Cultural District OK place go. However, last night's dinner plain bad. I beef salad, coolish beef iceberg lettuce sliced onions totally forgetful sauce. Nothing like mix sweet, sour, spice have. I also tofu panang. It also virtually tasteless. Some coconut milk flavoring otherwise nondescript brown sauce spiciness.
A lovely name terrible resturant. The food bland, bland bland. How place serve flavorless food stay open years beyond me. The inside resturant cramped poorly maintained. I decided play safe ordered broccoli garlic sauce. The sauce slimy broccoli water logged cooked. As set pot luck warm water hours served me. I'm noticing theme horrible resturants 6th Street I don't like it.
Don't waste time money. Rude service, pizza subpar. So many better options right around. Please dont cut corners quality product. The bar looked small quaint. ..maybe beer really cold I hit bad day. For pizza? Na ...won't back! NEXT!!!
Here go again. When comes office lunches, there's never question. We're heading San Remo. It's hard hate pizza general because, well, it's pizza! San Remo's pizza quality pretty standard, opinion.The crust (my favorite part) always full crispy - I like it. Then got super gooey cheese, choice toppings, loaded free layer grease. Mmmm, heartburn never tasted delicious. In preparation dreaded bikini season, I opted salad (a.k.a. random pizza toppings lettuce) time around. Just awful. The vegetarian salad option tossed salad, I didn't much choose from. The vegetables cut large nuisance eat, it's actually overpriced horrible quality salad get. Sorry San Remo - salads don't seem thing. SERVICE IS HORRENDOUS!!! It really pure torture sometimes. We come big group usually (10-20 people), reservation made. We show up, tables set up. Ugh. But biggie - agree split different tables. Our group usually orders 6-8 pizzas, always takes full hour get food. Ridiculous, especially expecting us there. We get waitress every time never fails completely RUDE everyone group. Come lady, honestly cranky everyday life? I understand bit hectic serving big group, 'tude ain't helping anyone. To conclude, average pizza paired AWFUL service. Pass!
An extra large pizza small barely fed wife I. Also pizza bad.
I've stayed twice last 2 years first time I went 5 stars I stayed last week good. The room clean! The sheets wrinkled, trash trash can, shower soap stains door... It make feel gross. If stay don't stay cheap rooms since apparently upgraded rooms jacuzzi's them.
So we've couple times. It's cute little place, reminiscent little corner ice cream place went kids. Now isn't Cold Stone quality stuff, it's decent cheap. Plus REAL Slush Puppies, old school style. It's little confusing walk up, can't tell whether taking orders window inside shop. Minor problem though. I forced deduct two stars, however, I visited today. I ordered small cookies cream "Flurry" shocked, nay, FLABBERGASTED learn place, nerve call business, uses FAUX Oreo cookies. I don't even know I walk street store ever again. They may well given Rocks Gravel Flurry. A travesty, really.
live blocks away hidden old time gem. honest, don't stray far soft serve cone - twisted chocolate & vanilla that's totally covered jimmies. but, it's always hit!! bad thing? can't really figure hours, may neighborhood thing (see j'eet)...but, least light big plastic cones front let know they're around.
Captain's Log Stardate: Circa 2004 - 2006-ish... I lived hour half outside city. Coming usually pretty exciting. (Here city, Silky's.) I friend lived East End street I reside now. Several times found Silky's Pub. I love corner building, way looks onto Liberty Ave. It looks welcoming. Especially summer. Outdoor seating, always pretty well packed people. I'll come right say crowd frequents Silky's isn't usual crowd, unlike bars I'd never issue someone wanting start fight us look like bunch dirty malcontents. This place usual dive bar. Thursday night boyfriend texted mutual friend. Living less city block I headed over. I needed beer hockey/world series action distract Halloween parade. It busy usual. A seats remaining I managed snag one right bar, front center. I hate say I don't remember happening years ago I went there. I even acknowledged. I get flagging bartender crazy busy bar South Side Friday night. I don't like I get it. This moderately steady Thursday night. I wasn't standing behind people's sitting bar. I person sitting bar. There two male bartenders bartenders asked guy next multiple times wanted anything else drink. By "multiple times" I mean 6 8 times. The person sitting directly beside me. They wouldn't look me. I tried make eye contact either I wasn't even there. Eventually boyfriend's beer emptied well. This 20 minutes I arrived. I've people walk stand behind us bar tender waitress immediately. After another 5 minutes boyfriend's beer perched precariously edge bar bartenders standing chatting ask bartender refill I could drink. The bartender looks him, grabs pint glass angrily bar says, "Oh, wanted another?" Really? I angry point took everything I ask guy issue was. I later saw drop pint glass stumble something many drunk. The food people ordered smelled looked great. Even seafoody bits I normally hate smelling. The tv's plentiful newer. I don't know I'll ever get go back try food I hate slighted business owner treated business isn't appreciated.
My 2nd city. And one favourite sports bars. TVs everywhere, great beer selection locals like East End harder find bars like Lagunitas. Oh shuffleboard. As far I'm concerned greater drinkin game. Write .
They amazing tap beer selection. Several small tvs. But Steelers aren't playing, old school pop music background noise, instead another football game. I'm sure it's bartender, made weird vibe.
My experience terrible. A 15 minute wait draft beer slow night? No thanks.
Not impressed. Went group friends dinner. I ordered special, BBQ chicken tacos tater tots. It took forever appetizer food come table. My tacos soggy I couldn't pick second one up, ate fork. The juice tacos also made tater tots extremely soggy. Everyone else group disappointed way visit.
Went Little Italy Days Bloomfield. After buying three beers bar, getting carded, party three sat table. We received attention waitstaff. When I went back bar buy another round party, I carded again, bartender glasses short hair. At point, I told I could buy beers party, even though already presented IDs initially, would need see everyone's IDs again. I went back table, collected everyone's IDs, presented bartender. He flipped out, told get service wait staff. Meanwhile, wait staff thought taking care bar. So rather waiting flag waitresses, three us went bar, presented IDs. The bartender lashed ignored us completely. In fact walked several times emptied trash, rather attend order. Thankfully bartender took care us. I've before, hadn't bad experience, tonight awful.
Mediocre food also over-priced. Ordered Reuben brought bottom bread soggy (maybe sitting long). Confronted waitress awkwardness ensued wouldn't take plate right away resolve issue. The solution: THEY GAVE ME A NEW PIECE OF TOAST ON A PLATE TO REPLACE THE SOGGY BREAD MYSELF! And top off...they didn't discount bill AT ALL. I think terrible Rueben around $10.99 soft drinks NO FREE REFILL! This Silky's Pub place complete JOKE.
Flies place.
I love Boston Market too!! I seldom sit location usually get take out. Their chicken always downright tasty moist (I'd suggest asking side bbq sauce - brings meal whole dimension!!) I hard time deciding sides. You can't go wrong mac n cheese, vegetables, corn, stuffing sweet potato yams. The cream spinach however seems different time order it. The cornbread still good seems reduced thickness. I've also chicken pot pie scrumptious. Boston Market always hits spot service always peppy complaints.
I've enjoyed ten years laundromats across great country, thanks fun whimsical life borderline poverty. Laundry Liberty worst, taken title dumpy laundromat San Francisco, homeless man used stand machines stare cast hexes something every person entered. I say I haven't hexed LoL, there's that. But I'm pretty sure I'm breathing sort evil fungus every time I go there. An evil fungus, case didn't know, smells sort like wet sock's moist fart that's fermenting fartiness, thereby releasing new, noxious farty gases, ferment further, on. It's sort like entropy, I'm pretty sure it's moving toward kind equilibrium. Actually, may like entropy all. I'm scientist! I laundry Laundry Liberty! So, yeah, smell. And machines, blow. You play Russian roulette quarters every time. Probably third washers leave clothes soapy puddle eat quarters, work all. I'm pretty sure there's hot water there, either, forget actually cleaning clothes that's mind went laundromat. The dryers also seem follow 1/3 dysfunctional rule (or 2/3 functional, optimists). Sometimes dry clothes; sometimes spin clothes around pleasantly cool breeze quarters' time exhausted. Which brings price. LoL expensive laundromat I've ever to! I went fancypants yuppie laundromat San Francisco (not one evil wizard), cost less (I won't make sad too-true tales EVERY machine worked, time). And know San Francisco storefronts rent 10,000x more, business owners need make much pay living expenses pricey, pricey city. So Laundry Liberty expensive busted? Now I'm sad, real sad.
This place new owner. The owner literally walked horrific nightmare pathetic hell hole . Now laundromat nice . It clean cheerful colors décor. If machine order owner places large colorful sign broken machine. This unlike previous owners use rip signs customers placed broken machines. If since new owner taken over, walk look inside. As picture shows, holes wall. The back floor completely done rugged cement floor. The machines clean grit inside outside. Definitely much much much nicer place. This still 24/7 new owner put bull crap.
Very good service. Came oil change, informed things might need changed future, made feel guilty I declined. The service worker even gave tip making sure toll money no-where site I get next service change avoid tempting dishonest people (turns corners bills showing one compartment...all bills still there). He gave 10$ discount even though I didn't come coupon, oil change complete 20 minutes. Will go back.
Terrible experience. I dropped car 9:25 AM Saturday one person front me. I didn't leave 11:05AM charged $99 synthetic oil changed. Overpriced, terrible customer service, long wait times. Never coming back here.
I went jiffy lube routine oil change. I waited hour half, busy, I understood. However, I driving home check engine light came (within 5 minutes leaving jiffy lube). I pulled read car manual said meant emissions problem. I knew jiffy lube guys taken air filter out, I figured probably failed reconnect everything properly. I turned around went back jiffy lube. However, I got explained situation, I told would another 2 hour wait could help me. After back forth, called manager. He basically denied possibility could related anything done, tried tell car happened, coincidentally, problem. Finally, agreed let pull front hook car diagnostic machine. They got back vague error code (p0420 - catalytic efficiency threshold), denied responsibility, sent way. I'm $50 still don't know what's wrong car. All I wanted simple oil change!!!! I never, ever go back jiffly lube - especially one.
Very bad service. They extremely slow. I waited 90 minutes even though 2 cars front me. I bought signature service includes vacuuming didn't all. When I told that, lied said did. And every time go, tell filter needs changed. How filter need replacing every 1000 miles? I think run filter scam. Never going back here!
This place sucks. They incredibly slow ridiculously priced. They charged 55 oil change took hour half one car infront me. Never go here.
Very long wait. Very slow service. Do favor stay away place. The workers don't seem care long takes wait.
Jiffy lube sucked. Took hour, cost $50, broke air filter. When I went next time, broke glove box. They break shit.
Incompetent employees can't perform simple task correctly (changing serpentine belt) even fix problem screwed up. Walter's Automotive street took care easily reasonable rate.
Go want served uncooked fish, odd tasting salad, way sweet tea (btw - unsweetened).
I visiting weekend looking somewhere go watch LSU versus Alabama game chose Lot 17. When arrived able find seats bar since barely anyone there. They nice selection draft beers. The food definitely average bar. The sweet potato fries good advertised dipping sauce could consumed straw TV selection leaves little desired. I understand PITT bar 95% bar focused LSU/Alabama game would think could moved PITT game corner TV use center TV sound majority bar concerned 'Epic' game. They switch games around PITT half soon game started LSU game back relegated corner. The manager even made comment group didn't appreciate whatever it's like I back anytime soon. If looking good bar food I say stop by. If looking watch big game outside Pennsylvania sports may want choose elsewhere relegated corner without sound.
If I'm rating Lot 17 solely food, you'd one two stars next review, since NFL Sunday Ticket it's chill place go Sunday catch game I'm willing give three stars. The food good...at least everything I've tried. Even bar food, Lot 17 struggles put decent product. The zucchini strips way greasy. Yes, I've never met non-greasy fried zucchini strip, saturated almost taste like came bag pre-breaded. Definitely lacking hand-breaded aspect. The chicken nachos made seemingly-stale tortilla chips bland I actually left half plate uneaten. That's rarity me, self-proclaimed nacho addict. I've also tried cheese wedges chicken tenders. The cheese wedges another product seems simple pull off, yet come cold greasy. The app enjoy al chicken tenders, they're decent, rest food we've tried blah I haven't able bring ordering actual meal sandwich menu. Hence, see review apps. Fortunately, hope seems lost, flip game solid beer list swoops save day. Service spotty, it's decent bar every time we've gone. At point I'll try sandwich meal, it's really hard fake appetite knowing kind product they're willing serve appetizers. Hopefully I'll able improve review trying menu. Fingers crossed.
I've twice ordered to-go once. The food bad! Last night table ordered French fries, stuffed portabella mushrooms, calamari. The best dishes mushrooms stuffed w crab meat topped w red peppers...the fries calamari terrible! I don't want come back here...it's priced food ave
My husband I visited quiet Friday afternoon, politely greeted bartender. We ordered beer promptly served. After taking moment glance menu, decided pita pizza app, special (beer battered fish/Mac cheese) fish tacos. The pita pizza: soft pita shell pesto, tomatoes, chicken cheese. BORING. This appetizer reminded mother's Irish cooking: tasteless. A simple addition caramelized onions would solved problem. Entree 1: Beer battered fish Mac cheese. Ruling: BLAND. My husband ordered one described fish "wet" Mac cheese "play-doh". They also served dish lettuce, tomato onion, sandwich. Entree 2: Fish tacos. Ruling: OVERCOOKED/COVER-UP ATTEMPTED. Ok, weren't bad, fish dry. Covered tomatoes bit lettuce, tacos were, again, tasteless side. The attempt adding flavor came chipotle mayo sour cream. These helped moisten fish. The corn relish masked jalapeño peppers rice came shaped small flowerpot. The service quite friendly, so, fault there. The chef, however, needs bit training.
As Colorado native transplant Bronco fan, real deal.....New York style da burgh. little hole wall Bar next door owns Fiori's way cool. You bring Pizza cold one watch local yokels Steelers t-shirts play pool talk past glory's gone by!
I stopped due Caliente overly crowded due CBS release. I ordered works burger. I asked medium I received well done burger. The Cajun fries lukewarm temperature. The atmosphere taps average. This textbook neighborhood bar. I would seek place out, I lived doors I'd stop in. The food underwhelming. I rounding 3 stars.
Admittedly, I'm pizza snob, I lived Italy number years I'm hard impress comes American Pizza. All thick crust nonsense drives nuts - I want good balance crust, sauce, cheese & toppings mouthful bread. Fiori's delivers TASTY pizza. Will I say it's type pizza Italy, absolutely not, it's still really freaking good. I give 5 stars pizza, I would recommend ordering mozzarella sticks - less stellar simple food item, I surprised bad were.

We've lot car dealerships last weeks, hands-down, worst experience bunch. We first ignored, made sit wait pricing 20 minutes, apparent reason. We definitely going back.
waitresses salty. food mediocre (at best). place total dump. however, it's open late, cook mustache rad. also, meet funniest people ever there.
The positive thing I say place open late. We ate breakfast food 2:30 bars closed. Pancakes burnt. Hash browns burnt. A breakfast sandwich weird burnt meat it. I drunk I don't remember. Bah. Cook/waiter funny, points that. Again, good thing open I wanted food.
My wife I like personnel Rohrich sales staff service people. This 5th Toyota 10 years.
Classic Rohrich telling customer fix tire update state inspection $100 calling back requoting $500. Classic Rohrich charging inspection, tell you'd rather pay tire elsewhere. Which failed, tire. Classic Rohrich letting know questions may regarding lease directed towards 1-800 number, big sign front says Toyota, affiliated Toyota. Classic Rohrich waiting 15 minutes talk human immediately redirected, waiting another 15 minutes talk another human, immediately redirected, waiting another 15 minutes talk human getting answering machine. You could leave message, they'll never get back you. Classic Rohrich charging hidden fees end lease. Classic Rohrich hanging disagreement. Classic Rohrich acting defensive blame shifting whenever problem arises. Rohrich Toyota joke dealership. Don't waste time money here. Pittsburgh full dealerships, go anywhere else.
Very professional crew. They quickly efficiently service I went despite bit late keeping late finish.
I purchased car Toyota Rav4 family member bought car new every service call done Rohrich problems. Well, soon car name, I start issue issue, I began take Rohrich. Some one t-boned flawless service call. Got new inspections well. The problems began I agreed oil consumption test. I working Dave car eating oil. So I consent oil consumption test, fail, means oil system car would need replaced warranty Toyota footing bill. Then shortly after, I needed replace alternator like. I asked I wanted new refurbished parts went refurbished. The first one put didn't work, second (without consent) put new alternator, insisted I pay difference (of couple hundred dollars) I picked up. We budget tightly unfortunately, didn't couple hundred extra dollars lying around throw alternator, I asked take out. I refused, told already lost money labor (which I get, still consented, especially b/c huge price difference). Ultimately, ended splitting difference. However, I call back inquire come fix oil system, calls fell deaf ears. I left 1 2 messages August, told weren't scheduling warranty replacements September they'd call, left 3 I wasn't called back October November. I started call back March b/c I needed replace tires. I speak different salesman, Mike, upbeat replacing tires, I mentioned oil consumption test, began getting little wishy washy. This Friday, said he'd call back Monday. Monday, Tuesday Wednesday came went. I called left another message. The weekend came went. I called Monday afternoon, busy, I left yet another message yet get call back. Unless dropping hundreds dollars, Rohrich could care less makes amount effort help out.
A great option options. If find devastatingly hungry Bloomfield 3am drunk drive walk ANYPLACE else, sure, go it. Otherwise, take pass- insides thank morning. The times I eaten induced self loathing worst kind.. thing worse stomach cramps brought result- I drunk seemed like good idea moment.
Its tiny, greasy hole wall I love it. I went breakfast band tour, prices small touring band-friendly! Breakfast isn't really hard do, I hadn't anything resembled home cooking I needed place. This must anytime I'm town.
This place worst french fries I ever tasted. They literally BLACK. All I tasted burnt oil. My photo zucchini planks lump blackness French fries I sent home with. I could even eat one! I also ordered zucchini planks grilled cheese rye bacon. The grilled cheese incredibly dry cook put bread together upside down, like match up...One piece bread opposite way other. Also sandwich stick together like melted sandwich should. Ugh. The zucchini planks delicious. 1 3 great. My sister raved place. I disappointed. Disgusting. DO NOT EAT HERE. I spent $30 one edible thing worth $4. So pissed!
"I think you're going Pittsburgh, use Heinz ketchup (catsup)" I asked alternative ketchup options (for reasons based principal, quality concerns questionable concerns regarding "too big fail" companies lobby relatively concerning things impacting lives smallest subtlest ways). Nonetheless, I saddened The Sandwich Shop closed. =/ The food otherwise delicious.
Disappointing. The food average service ok. We expecting lot restaurant definitely deliver. Pasta homemade sauces mediocre best. Wine selection weak. The outdoor seating redeeming quality.
Solid American Italian food that's making pretense anything else. The service incredibly friendly, food well thought out, promised, ample portions. Half price wine Monday Wednesday. Will headed back.
Very average Italian food. If you're looking pasta+sauce experience, it's pretty boring. Eggplant parm little better average. But all, exciting I make jar sauce box pasta.
I wasn't expecting much (as I'd never heard place randomly walked today) I didn't leave much either. My dad I average-tasting hoagies lunch. I chicken parmesan hoagie. It quite overcooked I still taste burnt breading mouth.
I'm sorry, place simply good. Unfortunately, yet another example poorly made Americanized Italian food. Too much cheese, much butter cream, quite possibly worst bread I ever consumed Italian restaurant life. Someone go way find bread flavorless awful. It's already travesty it's served meal, put sandwich! I'm actually offended Italians, bread. Yes bread, best. The eggplant Parmesan served mother soggy, covered absurd amount plastic Parmesan cheese swimming bland sauce. My fathers pasta, cream cheese. Contrary popular believe, traditional Italian! This would refer as, terrible heavy. And cannoli? Words could describe disappointment. I'll admit it, I'm already Italian food snob. I cook tons Italian food myself, family, friends, I use highest quality ingredients go preparing meals traditional southern Italian ways. I've phenomenal Italian meals great Italian restaurants city, whenever I get opportunity eat another "Italian" joint, I'm heading high expectations. Is Italian food Pittsburgh come too? Seeing similar Italian places Bloomfield, I'm sad say...yes. I'm actually slightly upset even writing waitstaff charming, I hear owners great, pass representative Italian food injustice. If want truly great Italian meal please look elsewhere.
I've eaten Alexander's decade, but, like Del's, it's becoming one places food gets worse every time go there. Today, half lettuce I Caesar salad rotten. I idea ever left kitchen. And take-out, too, wasn't much I could driving way home. (They gave wrong entrée too, least edible.) I finally think I'm done place.
I AM BOYCOTTING ALEXANDER'S FOR LIFE!!! The manager SCREAMED AT ME top lungs epic meltdown lasted 10 minutes! On Sat., April 12, 2014, I attended 50th birthday party dear friend, David Flynn. I organized party, relied Dave sister provide final head count. I made reservation 25 people. The manager I played phone tag two days event. I called back left messages TWICE confirm, apparently never got messages. (This part rant, indignation unreturned phone calls actually HAD returned!) The dinner started 7 PM. Most group arrived time, group (including me) arrived 8 PM-9 PM. I working homemade birthday present Dave, took longer expected. I called Dave, sister friends (Reesa & Joel) tell I running late. In hindsight, I also called restaurant let know, I truly sorry. That still doesn't justify manager SCREAMING AT ME FOR 10 MINUTES! After enjoying delicious dinner, drinks birthday cake, none us clue anything wrong. If decision return restaurant based SOLELY food wait staff, I would definitely return Alexander's. But sadly, manager nuclear meltdown throws 10-MINUTE SCREAMING TEMPER TANTRUM, tends sour one returning restaurant. Towards end dinner, us started smell cigarette smoke, later realized coming patio front. (It warm night, front sliding-glass doors open.) In midst smoke discussion, manager approached table began EPIC RANT, SCREAMING AT ME FOR 10 MINUTES!!! He angry everyone group hadn't arrived exactly 7 PM. The restaurant's kitchen open till 10 PM Sat. night, I don't understand big deal. We ended 20 people total 5 no-shows. I always disappointed no-shows, I explained possibility manager I made reservation. I STILL BROUGHT HIM 20 PAYING CUSTOMERS! BTW...the dining room practically EMPTY, I would expect Saturday night Pittsburgh. Maybe I'm first customer receiving end manager's meltdown. The manager SCREAMED called twice, I hadn't called back! He ranted dozen times. I told I HAD called back - TWICE. It's fault didn't get messages. He SCREAMED put extra waitress cook staff expected 25 people. He SCREAMED I cost restaurant $100! How much money think 20 people spent appetizers, dinner drinks? I find hard believe didn't make money, least break even. I sorry 5 no-shows group, I always thought Saturday night busiest night week restaurants. I didn't realize restaurant would look like deserted, old western ghost town hardly customers. On Saturday night, I assumed would full staff duty without reservation. I wrong. I'm sorry. I'm perfect. The manager also YELLED friends "LOOKING COMFORTABLE" restaurant!!! Since looking comfortable OFFENSE??? I thought restaurants wanted feel comfortable, apparently Alexander's. He also SCREAMED one waitresses got $1.00 tip! I found hard believe, case wasn't making up, I tipped waitress $35 $26 dinner check! I former waitress, I would feel HORRIBLE waitress every got ripped watch! Even story wasn't true, I figured deserved extra big tip WORK horrible place manager YELLS paying customers!!! If treats customers way, I imagine treats employees. THE MANAGER'S RUDE BEHAVIOR HAS COST HIM MY BUSINESS AND MY FRIENDS' BUSINESS FOREVER!!! During rant, actually SCREAMED never wanted see restaurant ever again! I'm happy grant wish. And friends. This example WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I ever witnessed entire life!!! I thought manager going heart attack stroke way SCREAMING FOR 10 MINUTES! SCREAMING paying customers completely unacceptable behavior, I NEVER eat Alexander's ever again. It's really shame I loved salmon pesto sauce. But great food can't make manager throws TEMPER TANTRUM SCREAMS AT YOU. Also, smell smoke dining room, sucks. My friends I BOYCOTTING ALEXANDER'S FOR LIFE!!!
Alexander's offers worst Italian food I've ever had. I went girlfriend parents Saturday night, start finish experience Alexander's gave us simply awful. First, arrived around 6 pm, restaurant half-empty (bad sign #1). The hostess seated us table center cramped small dining room (bad sign #2). Then, waitress even come take drink orders another 10 minutes (bad sign #3). Once waitress finally arrived took orders, food offered relief. My girlfriend I ordered Caesar salad - salads drowning Caesar dressing, croutons badly burnt inedible, many croutons begin with. This restaurant couldn't even get simple salad right, I hoped hope entrees would improvement. Unfortunately, entrees better. My girlfriend ordered Chicken Alfredo. Not dish absurdly light chicken (3 small pieces total? Come on!), alfredo sauce thick gummy point tasting like glue. My mom ordered Mushroom ravioli, completely bland. I ordered Veal Diablo Shrimp; plate came 3 pieces veal sliced extremely thin, 3 nice sized shrimp, and... it. No pasta, garlic bread, nothing ocean mediocre marinara sauce. I finished entire plate, remaining half mom's plate finished eating, much I could stomach girlfriend's Alfredo (which couple forkfuls, Alfredo sauce one foulest things I've ever eaten), I still left hungry. The dessert course offered distinctly rotten cherry top already heaping garbage sundae. We initially assured desserts made in-house, soon proved case. Indeed, several desserts, store-bought version would improvement. I ordered cannoli, figuring even crappy Italian restaurant can't screw cannoli, violation Italian Law something. Unfortunately, "fresh-made" cannolis consisted pre-packaged cannoli shell, pre-packaged cannoli filling (which, way, gritty, though someone dumped white sugar mixed cream thoroughly enough sugar dissolve), put two together kitchen. Needless say, cannoli awful. My girlfriend ordered tiramisu, received far removed tiramisu one get. There almost ladyfingers, ones dish drowning coffee. On top that, dessert swamped excessive amount coffee-flavored cream essentially destroyed dish. My uncle's chocolate cake dry uninspiring; store-bought cake would moist. I pick check - uncle nice enough - I see final bill. However, could paid eat often-inedible food. The service slow inattentive, food simply awful, I left hungry. Do waste time, money, energy place, get better Italian food virtually anywhere else city.
I extremely disappointed w/ experience Alexander's last evening. I visited restaurant past remember much better? Also, I can't believe Bloomfield offer, 'Italian' district Pittsburgh - kidding? First all, house Chianti tasted like vinegar. Pasta dishes average $15 didn't even come w/ house salad. They come w/ soup? however, offered forgot morning. All pasta dishes party ordered well entrée salads mediocre (chicken looked like processed?) didn't many ingredients outlined menu. And, top night off, I got sick mine night w/ indigestion. UGH!! I looking forward low-key family dinner something good start holiday weekend restaurant came short.
Being Italian I eating Italian science , said I ordered carbonara seafood side traditions carbonara little twist said don't always get want .
I used dine every years, last two times disappointment. The overall quality food seems gone downhill, less emphasis traditional Italian cooking. Some pasta underdone (not al dente), seasonings bland side. An exception turkey Devonshire, isn't exactly Italian, Pittsburgh original. I wouldn't go back Italian entrees, overpriced underwhelming salad bad I write it. After ordering entrees, waiter asked would like soup salad. I chose Caesar salad, assuming included price entree, restaurants. I don't mind paying $7 salad, I like know I'm paying it, Caesar salad worth $7. It wasn't even Caesar salad. It small side salad iceberg lettuce croutons Italian dressing. If I known I would charged it, I would asked Parmesan cheese maybe anchovies.
Really bad Italian food. Probably worst I've ever had. The worst American version Italian food.
Crappy, boring, limpid. The pastrami tasted bland, bread borderline stale uninteresting, whole sandwich little wet lukewarm. Got Penn Pilsener bar, unmistakable taste dirty lines - little sour tang lactic bacteria. How place "famous"? Is really? Can anyone please brine brisket hand-slice it?
Hadn't years remembered I enjoyed undergrad, especially late night half off. Called advance make sure open 10 half like used to. The woman answered phone said yes I rushed over. The portions small, I assumed half price I shrugged off. The tomato sauce chunky generic, raita side dish 4 spoonfuls big, chutney dips cold bland. Assuming due discount, I didn't complain. Receive check find full price. Despite woman telling phone half off, buy one get one half off. The woman phone hostess. She admitted answered yet refused accommodate mistake. I don't normally feel compelled complain ridiculous. A subpar meal subpar service addition false marketing. Never going back despite fond memories I accumulated school. Completely ridiculous.
We ordered Valentine's Day knew would take bit longer usual. Unfortunately took way longer though. It completely understandable expected situation. Overall positive experience since handled situation well got partial discount. Sorry happened way staff handled situation extremely well. Thanks!
This place use good back opened. People roaches place, food make sick sauces full cornstarch. We'll never return. Sorry Peoples
You don't want identify familiar taste chicken tikka masala Campbell's tomato soup... But tell isn't reminiscent?! I ordered go-to chicken tikka masala saag paneer recently. Again, I disappointed meat dish. And saag wasn't much better. It pretty lacking flavor department too... From past experience, I'd say vegetarian dishes better bets People's vs meat.
Terrible. At moment I currently cursing People's Indian Restaurant's lunch. I ordered friend work ordering process fairly simple (grub-hub) arrived reasonable amount time quality meal seriously standard. I love Indian food one thing I love complexity flavors. This flat, one note. A earlier review mentioned tikka masala reminiscent Campbells tomato soup - well add butter chicken experience. The chicken metallic like taste get microwaved meat compliment bland taste food - hey, nothing, consistent awful meal prepared. Right now, I sitting desk body actively fighting indigestion. Yep, place terrible. 4 star average? Wow, shocking... countless Indian meals I far worst. Update: 8 hours later still feel sick meal. Ugh. Never again.
My first last experience: Worst delivery service. My food order given someone else waiting another food delivery apartment lobby without even asking restaurant ordered from. Delivery guy rude, said girl lobby Indian thought girlfriend, instead apologizing. Never ordered again.
Not great ..... Service friendly fast....waiters cologne overwhelming unpleasant samosas salty didn't curry flavor I'm used to...,chicken saag didn't enough sauce seasoned I tasted heat lacked Indian curry flavor.....I'm really angry people recommended place.
I ordered chicken masala, pakora chat aloo chat delivery. The food came half hour sooner expected, come chats felt like scooped vat fridge never heated up? They looked old one smelled old. I decided eat chicken masala first since thing warm, bland, unappealing I decided I heat 2 dishes try make it. Both dishes extremely unappealing well. I sadly throw away. I always order indian food requesting low spice number, never accounted loss taste like this. I didn't even know could go wrong chicken marsala! I easily say worst indian food I ever eaten.
Maybe I went bad day food pretty darn terrible. The spring rolls falling apart filled noodles couple sad looking shrimp, thai basil mint leaves cilantro speak of. I also got crispy noodles seafood I ate I sitting train 9 hours starving. And whole thing seriously overpriced Pittsburgh, New York prices extremely subpar vietnamese, meh.
Compared it's location I prefer going one slightly closer I believe better selection. Every time I've gone I left great deal. While prices already low sales everyday make merchandise even cheaper. They small dvd furniture section, complaint place.
I like store, used favorite. I found really nice items I don't like go often THERE IS NO FITTING ROOM. Ugh. They used one got rid said people abused it. It's shame frustrating bad customers ruin things rest us. I've bought nice tops I got home found didn't fit. I know price isn't bad it's aggravating waste time I can't try clothes on. I've seen anywhere 4-8 employees working, I don't understand don't one work fitting room like Walmart problem. There something fix issue. One thing I like everything organized color, makes convenient you're searching specific color. If I go here, I usually stick buying sweaters/things I try clothes. Please get fitting rooms back!!!! ;(
It's like stampede enter store! The least problem shoppers, staff gruff unfriendly. Wasn't worth me.
Parking sucks. It smelled. They way way overpriced! I saw bag priced $15 apparently donated yard sale another tag $3! Just really lots junk. Also it's cash place atm. Their clothes sorted color cool.
I've many thrift stores life one definitely priced! They selling items price I could spend item brand new! The store closes 6:00 inconvenient people work 9-5. I rush get work still didn't get 5:45. It cash establishment staff rude. I'd rather spend money Goodwill!
This place nothing cluster f*** everything kind thrown onto rack nothing color coordinated size coordinator gender coordinator. First time I went I disappointed I always see parking lot packed I idea now. And seems like everybody goes trashy rude. It tends bring worst people. I'm ashamed buy second hand clothing place like brings bad stereotype. I like nobles Town Road thrift store much better.
After contacting Boehmer day fix AC (OK fixed heater AND AC, else go wrong? knock wood) Sadly, time I feel totally taken advantage I need downgrade rating. Several people spoken stated paid WAY much part replacement, I agree seeing much part actually costs. The moral story call around estimates. Get diagnosis get several estimates compare. It seems like HVAC guys take advantage.
Very unprofessional!!!! Charged $650.00 quote/temporary a/c fix, said I would pay I signed expensive contract spot without getting quotes. Did put top back air conditioner done assessment. Asked employee look water tank said I "stupid" I got water tank size I currently have. FYI I whirlpool tub requires large water tank. DO NOT USE, AWFUL EXPERIENCE!!!
I also find odd reviews either 5 stars 1 star. Very unusual reviews. Maybe friends
At least two downtown still open
Very sad find donuts made day before. I ordered three dozen donuts $10 dozen, found stale bordering disgusting. With awesome donuts town, would sell "yesterday's donuts today's prices?" Won't returning baked products I idea may baked. The woman works counter sweet, I wanted support local business, sadly, I cannot.
I rarely write negative reviews. What disappointment. Based yelp son chose restaurant. I realize I city lots Thai restaurants beyond disappointing. The duck overcooked gristly. The salad nothing special. The spring rolls nothing special heavy something flavored. The soup warm hot served aluminum pot hard serve from. The server got order wrong. I think overpriced Pittsburgh restaurant well. Like I said I don't usually slam places waste money.
Was favorite restaurant, killed closed full service restaurant put tables bar. The menu smaller, food different nowhere good. Hardly ever go anymore, do, we're usually disappointed.
excited try place. thai one favorite cuisines ever!!! sorrily disappointed. started spring rolls, rice wrapper could see lettuce browning, sure sign rolls made order. pad thai dry tasteless. friends curry potatoes tasted like water touch curry powder. hate giving poor reviews nothing ate thai cuisine yummy.
I shocked recent favorable reviews place. The food frozen satisfying least. Parmigiana, matter contents, freshly breaded light fry. Not coated heavy batter. Same goes provolone wheel. It visible freezer burn brought table within 5 minutes ordered. Obviously prepared order. The bread fresh either. I'm genuinely disappointed recent changes. We would left seeing limited menu server wasn't sweet enough cash cover drinks tip her. We stuck left intention return.
My husband I went try new restaurant Brookline Blvd find closed Mondays. So I checked Yelp decided try restaurant. It's little awkward door bar Main Street walk alley get door dining room. We ones dining room. The bartender came give menus take drink orders. She nice explained dinner special was. A minutes later owner head chef came table. He really funny. He thick Italian accent. He told husband try special told I try lemon chicken. His name Lou takes food seriously. My husband ordered special-Chicken Chiu Chiu pasta. It grilled chicken, sliced banana peppers, mushrooms, rigatoni noodles. It sounds pretty simple whatever put sauce absolutely delicious. I able eat spicy food dish carried little heat I could eaten it. I bummed I ordered myself. I ordered Lemon Chicken pleasantly surprised. Usually Lemon chicken lemon sauce hint lemon. Because I asked came capers. The waitress told would put me. Once I tasted dish I realized sauce good didn't need capers. It best Lemon Chicken I ever had. The portion size huge. It surprise meal chicken-no sides even salad. Even though order chicken I took half home. My husband's dish came garlic bread sides salad. He took 1/3 home. The prices low, portions huge, meals great. We want go back try dishes.
Took friend chow thai restaurant. PROS: Have pad thai, wide noodles w/ black bean sauce, mango curry here. All good. The front desk welcoming. Decent prices ($10- 12/dish). They also daily specials menu, least dinner. CONS: Crab rangoon overfried- wouldn't recommend appetizer. Side street parking. Overall, back check rest menu.
I clearly stated I made appointment I lot anxiety I wanted treatment plan I knew I needed lot work. I came Dr. K yelp reviews experience quite opposite. He came minute introduce assistant handed finished I asked speak discuss treatment plan, popped head long enough blow tell well discuss treatment next time...umm, won't I won't back!
I agree 100% Maggie G's review. Over priced, bad food, Pittsburgh DOESN'T know GOOD Thai food.. Plus $40 bucks Take out...seriously? Ill pass I've better Thai less. Yellow Curry (Ive added picture exactly watery curry truly ) (x2) Spring Rolls (2 per order) Dumplings (5 per order) Wontons (4/5 per order) _____________ 40 BUCKS Ill stick Bangkok Balcony. No trying different Thai places city. I rather waste money watered curries bland dishes seems norm Pittsburgh Thai scene.
My favourite restaurant bakery pittsburgh
Bummer. Closed end January 2012 renovations.
I stopped past Tuesday father lunch. I wanting try Pitaland since I first saw boulevard excited finally make there. Whenever finally made inside, I expected good way. The store super clean, bright open olive bar, central aisle grocery items, deli food counter bar seats. They also tables outside eat weather nice. For lunch entree I decided go chicken shawarma donor size father went gyro donor size. While ordering I noticed rather clever tip jar sign something "pita" spelled backwards. After placing order decided sit inside counter day since sun humidity outside would made miserable experience. After minutes waiting, lunches handed us. My chicken shwarma came large pita lettuce, pickle, onion, tomato I think garlic mayo sauce? The size pita pretty large I knew time I finished I wouldn't need anything else. Sadly I disappointed sandwich mainly chicken. Since done rotisserie style I thought meant meat would good moist. However, ended super dry seemed overcooked well. The rest sandwich ended good though I really enjoyed larger pickles pita. The bottom line I might head back future. While chicken shwarma ended somewhat disappointment I think place potential I would like give another try.
My aunt picked place heard vegetarians. Normally, someone suggests place kinds fake meat menu, I insist finding better option, assured good I went it. I guess I underestimated ability prepare fake meat... serving Jewish community mean many customers vegetarian outside home. Mike I went fake duck dishes... mine (basil sauce) decidedly better (don't remember... something bland). The appetizers pretty standard, nothing stood particularly good bad. Overall, 3-star food, plus vegetarian options, plus byob... it's low 4.
Yummy! I love baklava, gyro chicken shawarma. My boyfriend likes pepperoni roll I haven't tried myself.
Food bad (I ordered green curry chicken), poor choice plates cups (tea cups like diner coffee mugs) didn't feel authentic. I would order take instead next time.
They deliver WheelDeliver.com
Descubrí Pitaland casualmente recomiendo encarecidamente visitarlo probar sus productos. Todo en la tienda está muy bien organizado limpio. Tiene buenos precios su comida es riquísima. Los dulces son un auténtico placer. El personal muy amable te hacen muy cómoda la visita.
much nicer inside renovated former Foodland space ... cafe interesting food crazy expensive end with, opinion...the beef schwarma tasty hummus / kibbee balls / etc. usually end getting tacos Las Palmas, doors since it's much better bargain fans middle eastern food ought check joint .
Let start saying I got wrong bus ended walking Garfield Bloomfield Bloomfield I proceeded get lost behind West Penn Hospital. With said I hoping stumbling around elements would vain. The food Thai Cuisine pitiful sense direction. I ordered Threes Company: shrimp, scallops calamari Thai chili sauce. The sauce favorite part Thai meal Thai Cuisine came short here. What I enjoy must Thai chili sauce complexity flavors sauce dish standard thin runny brown sauce. The kind comes lets say beef broccoli. I think menu description misleading I known would brown sauce I would ordered something else. Some onions dish cold leads believe food cooked order least it. There plenty shrimp dish calamari tasted great, dish lacked flavor. The carrots broccoli cooked beyond recognition. For hubby I ordered Thai steak , tasted like frozen salisbury steak dinner salisbury steak happens one least favorite foods. Had I sampled dinner would solid three star review. I see reason go back here.
Would rather eat anywhere else world. Green curry. Pad Thai. Yum yum yum yum yum. 5 Yums yum scale. And addictive.
If place affiliated bakery name Beverly Rd. Mt. Lebanon, steer clear. Bought 5 pastries today I managed drag clerk away socializing one I tasted stale, I took closer look others. They dropped quickly big box waxed paper fallen over. The icing damaged though stale hard. I husband take bite one confirmed bad. We broke others half determine fresh. Nope. Tossed went Prantl's.
It okay food, really I expected. The green curry actually yellow curry, oh well.
A year later, prices increased 70% quality food declined. Customer service still superb though. Today, I ordered pad-see-yew beef level 5 - made old pan burnt scraps, 25% beef dish only, clumps chili blended dish, drenched oil. Another dish, red curry chicken, always lacking chicken pieces, they've increased prices cut back portions quality, happens quite often good restaurants gone bad. Sad say, used favorite place, never return currently looking another Thai place go-to.
First all, despite hatred PF Changs, I love lettuce wraps. I'd dirty, horrible things lettuce wraps. These lettuce wraps PF Changs lettuce wraps. The search PF Changs comparable lettuce wraps continues. Besides that, food okay, nothing ordinary Thai food, little overpriced servings offering well quality.
TERRIBLE! I never order again. I hungry pizza found Bellisario's menu back desk (I suppose girl worked me) decided try them. Got pizza pepperoni slice cheesecake. When driver brought it, looked like sat pizza box. He opened box said box got bent cheese pepperoni stuck top box. He asked ok said one piece ruined. When really 3 slices toppings stuck top box. What I gonna say, I hungry, I took it. The pizza awful, greasy ehhhh can't even explain it. So I slice pizza done moved cheesecake, looked like month old tasted pretty bad well. Only bite threw away. I never order again!
owner terrible terrible person. tossed good reason. found food average overall
This perfect example really disgusting Pittsburgh style pizza, guys love awful crap reason. I called asked big medium was, idiot responded "8 cuts" obviously tells nothing considering cut anything 8. When I asked said 14 inches I ordered medium cheese order breadsticks. I confess I didn't actually try pizza I send back well past point edible. It like pizza soup crust bowl. This place using deck style brick ovens, thing right. They cook directly brick though, use pizza screens. The screens use ones really big holes opposed grid style screens everyone else uses. I never seen another shop use big hole screens, probably reason dough really really terrible cooked. It burned point black bottom (which I usually don't mind all) somehow managed still completely doughy soft least bit crispy. Honestly seems like kind miracle science black pizza bottom least little bit crispy. The pizza definitely overly thick doughy side even cooked well probably still would doughy good. The dough recipe may may tasted good, one probably ever know probably never cooked evenly enough even chance tasting good. The biggest problem pizza overall 2 pounds cheese sunken large gelatinous wad middle. It smelled like decent cheese, probably Grande (although probably cut something cheaper). They wasting much money cheese sad. Whoever pizzaman obviously took pride whatsoever. The sauce dropped middle cheese. The edges pizza big bubbles cheese sauce been, NOT nice crispy kind bubbles could enjoyed...just lumpy masses sadness. I can't comment taste sauce I brave enough man put slice DIY toilet clogging kit delicate stomachular system. Fake words aside, pizza really sucks guys. The icing cake breadsticks, side item I consider pretty un-f*ckable. So breadsticks, Mr. Bellesario (BTW, I hope made-up Italian restaurant name someone doesn't actually put family name behind crap) cuts slices premade Sicilian dough slaps oil herbs calls breadsticks. Its ghetto attempt particular appetizer I ever heard of. Its pretty funny, really. So yeah, place definitely worth avoiding costs especially considering prices aren't even good restaurant completely filthy inside. The owner nice enough refunding money pizza. Its shame I see businesses like set ways really wasting potential general lack pride.
This first time trying place since moving Castle Shannon. Delivery fast. The pizza really REALLY greasy. My wife went grab piece saturated grease everything fell off. Pizza pizza, wasn't terrible wasn't notably better others I've had. We also got order 10 hot wings. They also extremely greasy zero flavor kind sauce. Their texture rubbery "reheated" taste them. They pretty terrible. We won't ordering again.
This second time eating pizza here. They two doors Down McNeilly Six Pack Shop. You get food take six pack shop eat beers. The pizza top 5. The crust isn't thick thin. They put toppings pizza place I know. But good foundation build hopefully using toppings cover bad pizza. This pizza would great even plain cheese pizza. Now I hooked pizza I need try menu items.
We decided take chance "chicago-style" deep dish. Big mistake. It basically piece thick garlic bread (minus garlic) marinara sauce cheese. Bland get NOT deep dish. What heck wrong pizza joints city understanding concept deep dish pizza, let alone advertising "chicago-style" clearly not? Is kind patent deep dish pizza I'm aware of? Why hard get ahold city? The thing Bellisarios blatantly lies air conditioned dining room advertises sign front. It hotter restaurant outside, July, good thing. There's reason rating isn't harsh. I don't like knocking hometown pizza joints. I'm sure regular pan pizza good everyone says, I'll come back get instead. Plus I plate near perfect onion rings. And server pretty great. So I'll try again, deep dish disappointments. I can't handle sad angry makes me.
As saying goes, one Thai food door closes, another Thai food door opens... It Sunday afternoon. We hungry wanted Thai. We walked Thai Gourmet, usual go-to Thai spot, greeted "closed" sign door. They don't open 5 Sundays?! But I want Thai food NOWWWWW (feeling Veruca Salt day). Dejected, I walked rumbly tummy Liberty Ave, lo behold, another Thai restaurant appears blocks up. Whine ye shall receive. After perusing menu, decide take chicken pad thai another dish called "three flavored chicken." Both solid choices. The pad thai portion huge chock full good stuff (they skimp meat veggies here!) The sauce flavorful plentiful, yet light...not overly thick, oily, sticky, pad thai sauces be. The "three flavored chicken" also tasty crispy, breaded chunks white meat chicken. The sauce interesting unlike anything I've ever before. Despite name, I really tasted two flavors dominated sauce -- vinegar (sour) sugar (sweet). It could used spice round out, even so, still delicious. I wish broccoli vegetable I least felt little less guilty eating copious amounts fried chicken chunks :) And overall, tastes, dishes definitely could kicked spice intensity. We ordered level 8, I said, I couldn't really detect spice all. So 8, next time I'll probably order 33. :) Overall, yummy Thai food. I'm sure replace usual go-to Thai spot, it'll definitely high list!
recently ordered couple pizzas assuming mediocre suburban pizza . wrong . it's dalish . unique crust texture/consistency good pizza 'guts' . delivery time reasonable considering live outward fringe delivery area. driver 'cool' able communicate native english (i'm really tired pizza joints owned serbians/russians/middle-easterners can't / hardly speak english...one admire tenacity making life ....) repeat customer bellisario's ... hurray . new fave pizza joint area (outside Fiori's)
My boyfriend I recently moved area spoke highly place decided order delivery. However, called told man phone lived Overbrook mile away. He proceeded rudely challenge lived close idea talking about. We told located simply turn left 51 make second right. He scoffed said I'll honest I idea won't deliver there. Completely unprofessional ridiculous. We go back order.
Today, I seriously worst experience I ever restaurant. I feeling manager in. All five employees I saw 18 (which, 21 year old, entirely ageist comment). Even though five customers store, took nearly 20 minutes prepare five orders, already taken. The cashier also lot trouble counting money--her goal give back $7.02 change, took $5 out, said "Oh shit," loud, thought second, I reminded I need $2.02 more. All five orders exactly one item missing trays, things cashier responsible for. She forgot chips taco salad, cheese two customers, incorrect drink another. My drink wound zero carbonation. I finally made way condiment counter, ketchup smeared it, including stack ketchup cups. There literally zero napkins, I go ask behind counter. Many tables stray napkin straw wrapper. While eating one them, one employees dining room, yelling towards counter (from 20 feet away), "Can please tell Gary fucking change garbage cans?" five times. The cashier responded doesn't want "yell" Gary again. As I cleaned tray, I discovered reason garbage cans desperately needed changed--I tried three restaurant, full I could barely open swing door them, let alone put anything inside. I finally settled putting full tray top entire garbage receptacle, I option. None exaggeration. I seriously appalled.
Can place get order correct 1st time? I think not!
Pretty interior, spiffy soda fountain, Worst. Service. Ever. I've multiple problems crew store since re-opened, yesterday evening took cake. I went pick last minute food family immediately suspicious I saw half dozen people milling unhappily food pickup location, one giving food. When I questioned cashier delay, another customer actually came back demanded refund couldn't wait longer. When I noticed half crew seemed sitting dining room watching TV. I've store frequently definitely pattern poor incompetent service. Almost every order I've placed something forgotten incorrect. There always crewmembers milling around nothing, playing TV case, rapping behind counter. I've store, I plan avoiding get people actually interested serving customers, I would strongly advise others same. At point I wouldn't even trust food comes kitchen. UPDATE: I able reach regional manager via email, replied briefly situation addressed. In last month, I 2 3 times simple take-out orders everything seemed go fine. Got I ordered reasonable amount time everyone crew working, blatantly goofing off. So added Star rating, even though I'm still kind leary.
Literally worst experience ever. You pay two meals get chicken nuggets bun instead chicken sandwich. Absolutely inexcusable funny all. Playing people's food money....two things mess with. When I went back refund kids seemed think rather funny offered make new one I refused I don't trust food God knows they're back there.
After reading 5 star ratings Carhops, decided give try. My hubby East Coast; therefore, particular subs. Carhops inside looks like old bar tables dinners. We ordered Z28 Carhops special. Z28 nothing cheesesteak sandwich almost minced meat onion pieces. The steaks thin minced. The sandwich tasteless. The Carhops special consists thinly sliced Italian meats, cheese, lettuce hot pickled peppers. The seeds pickled peppers taken sandwich, leaves taste vinegar pulps peppers bite. After meal, miss Charley's Philly cheesesteak sandwich, chain restaurant. Big disappointment!
Only 2 stars. I called 7/12/16 9:49 pm answer? Yelp well online website said close 11. I called multiple times giving up. I wanted tossed salad. Haha
Worst McDonalds!!! took 45 min one burger BULLSHIT!!! someone needs fired!
Seriously worst McDonalds I've ever to. Service always slow. I'm currently sitting parking lot right 4 cars drive thru waiting food. If I could read receipt (printer must low ink), I'd call corporate office tell fire whole place start over.
This isn't worst McDonalds town, least eventually get order correct. But situation inside fairly ridiculous. The crew day seems dozen employees, ever one person taking orders, wait person wander back post actual sell food. You see half dozen employees back apparently working cooking food, people still can't get food less 10 minutes. But waiting watching another half dozen employees take-out window chatting day away one person occasionally fills bag gets order out.
Every McDonalds employees hate job, never show it. The employees REALLY show it, point makes hate coming here. Instead greeted like customer, even "how you" I'm always greeted sigh attitude, followed "what cain uh fo yuh.." And matter I order, I'm given look I said something stupid. If I go drive though, it's usually quite bad, slow order almost never right seems like thrown together blind person. I understand McDonalds awful job, actually worst one I've ever to. It's 2 minute drive me, I always drive one 20 min away stay away one.
Had fried tofu appetizer, pad Thai tofu, Thai iced tea. Giving place 2 star bc tofu tasted like gone bad, I addressed waitress told kitchen without apologizing bad taste tofu. The noodles bad, quality service based experience deserves low grade place. Was unsatisfied experience, I always comment connect rating experience customer service. I ask discount bad food I throw fit waitress, I think anyone would wanted acknowledged eat bad tofu...
I drive several states & 3-4 thousand miles week. This second worse McDonalds number 1 winner located North Shore Pittsburgh window workers sit talk boyfriends glaring back drive-thru. They pull one napkin trick, fries usually shit IF already made, people nice enough looking really impolite store still sucks. Perhaps something wrong kitchen, maybe super cheap owner. However, people get raise $12/hr i'll kill myself!
This gross waste 28 dollars. My curry strips chicken chunks potatoes giant tub milk. Thai gourmet blocks awesome...too bad closed.
I hate location. I stop roommate it's way laundry. Every time, worse experience customer service. This time, cashier walked away taking roommate's order without offering receipt. Kind important thing they're yelling order numbers hand food. My cashier never handed cup drink. When I asked woman gave food, slammed cup tray look utter disgust. The woman practically threw silverware roommate serving hotcakes. Over time I've ignored, greeted "what want?", soda fountain malfunction telling MANAGER I told "that happens sometimes" (it's still broken six months!), dining room usually unmitigated disaster garbage tables seats plus overflowing garbage cans...I don't know else even worth adding point. As soon I find somewhere else go laundry mornings, I NEVER return McDonald's!
Worst Thai restaurant Pittsburgh. Ordered Gen. Tao's chicken tasted like sweet sour. Wonton soup broth weak like slurping soggy noodles tepid water. I'll never order again. Better go Thai Gourmet street.
Don't waste money!!! When I moved Brookline 8 years ago, I thought pretty decent restaurant. We always went wing night, wings large quite tasty. My favorite sauce honey jalapeno. While wings decent cheap size, I day one thought beers bit overpriced type bar location. The wings kept coming back, cheap, I didn't mind paying little bit beers. As time went on, menu seemed go changes...a less items, higher prices, severely decreased portion sizes. I understand anything, prices always going go up, time, quality remain get better! This case here, giving tries, I gave up. On last visits food absolutely awful, portions minuscule, overall overpriced. They also away 50 cent wing night. It always seemed owner concerned almighty dollar. I tried corned beef sandwich St. Patty's day last year, corned beef almost fat, bad took sandwich order new item menu. After I tried fish chips around lent, joke was! You got potato chips ( home made), tiny pieces fish almost breading. All "specials" have, whether food drink, worth prices place seems think are. All "special" prices places regular everyday prices! Definitely stay away, give money local establishment deserving money!
Note date review because, yes, place used awesome. I keep giving chances DONE. I worst meal ever here. It NV salad. It used favorite would come week back day. This salad nasty...they forgot cheese...forgot salsa sour cream...it disgusting. Ad draft beer luke warm. Not surprising empty used packed friday night dinner.
I feef waitress trained correctly never fired
This place used one favorites. We got sick getting fish Lent last year. Decided give another chance disappointed. Menu smaller I remembered, service slow, food (chicken) dry bland. Four waitresses standing around bickering. 5:30 Saturday two tables occupied. There reason that.
Awful service. We don't come often always decent experiences. Good food, quite value Armstrong's closer drive. Upon hearing new ownership, decided take family dinner. We walked "greeted" coldly server. Not great start gave pass knowing may going on. We seated asked drink order. Drinks came fast it. Once orders taken hill. The kids' food came quickly decent. Once received it, son decided wanted ginger ale. I told wait waitress came back would order one. She never did. Once started serving kids, realized didn't napkins silverware. We tried catch attention another waitress could not. The kids could eat pizza quesadilla hands needed napkins. My wife ended going bathroom paper towels. It became comical 15 20 minutes boys done eating steak salad steak hoagie come out. At point, table behind us caught another waitress walking by, "We've waiting 15 minutes check." We weren't ones forgotten here. We couldn't even ask son's ginger ale silverware table nobody stopped check us waitress missing 20 minutes. When food finally came out, almost hour. The kids done eating I asked could wrap up. "I'll bring boxes." Seriously? I could almost understand response troublesome. We didn't opportunity. In hour there, contact staff seated, ordering, receiving drinks half food. The touches decidedly negative. As I sat packing food family got coats on, I decided write review. What awful experience. The food OK. The quesadilla bacon it. Fine I guess call chicken bacon ranch quesadilla serve ranch dressing instead sour cream. Otherwise, make decent quesadilla. The kids pizza fine. The steak salad tasted fine kitchen table. The steak best part. The rest mostly head lettuce tomatoes cucumbers shredded cheese top. (Go Armstrong's want done right.) My steak hoagie actually two mini sandwiches. They soaked bread butter making fat pill even bigger. I wouldn't recommend it. Bellisario's across street way better. The fries fine. They busy general atmosphere, lack service, general lack caring makes place worst restaurant experience long time.
This place gone downhill. Sorry, guys. It used awesome, steak salad favorite. Huge filling. The last two times we've gone potato skins dried I could eat half steak made sick night. And service sad. I'll eat someone else paying it's choice place anymore.
Absolutely horrible service. 1 bartender/waitress per 40 customers... And owner sitting around drinking, watching game. I came watch playoff hockey game classical music blaring background. Had go bar order food, given attitude bartender/waitress. No thanks.
Gotta say I'm big fan, grew still miss day. If don't like grease...don't come door. This pizza people.

Standing ovation. I can't believe I forgot review place. Though I haven't back years, boo brought home slice day smelled like heaven. Iced tea carton? You cannot beat that.
Eat Fioris, said. Youll like it, said. conveniently located West Liberty Boulevard, restaurant features absolutely nowhere park road impossible get to. When I called place order miserable sounding answer phone side said need? I placed order said don't come it's going least hour get coworkers anything right. That really unprofessional. Some people may think character really I don't care kind day person taking pizza order I want place order without feeling im bothering them, You know illegally parked car pick order up. place filthy inside packed full people total mayhem. I would never ever recommend eating store even place clean you're still going people waiting pick three orders standing right you. It also hundred degrees there. They also take cash didn't mention sign I glad I cash hand. I knew something pizza 13 started leaking lid pizza driving home. The bottom top rated grease. How even happen? My friend said that's sign great pizza guy eating priorities disgusting. You're supposed take slice pizza pizza box toppings slide due thebgrease. restaurant could get away pizza greasy Vincents gone..you could caulk bathtub cheese that's rubbery was. It disgusting. red sauce tasted like ketchup sugar added. It gross I don't understand anybody likes restaurant poor service poor quality food prime example restaurant resting laurels legacy.
We Love Pie hoagies aren't bad either!!! Since kids walking here, Now driving cant pass craving Pizza. Not much changed, maybe paint color walls faces. Best Fiori says "We'll Fix-a up!" means it!!!!
Their cheese pizza must you're visiting Pittsburgh. Period. It's locals go too!
Best pizza burgh! Are favorites plain, plain cold cheese, pepperoni, steak meatballs italian hoagies.
I appreciated quality ingredients atmosphere much, style pizza really thing. It's thin NY style, greasy, cheese toppings wanna slide right off. And though tasty, got double pepperoni, mind means pepperonis pretty much covering pizza YES I realize cheese enough. Waiting pizza cool helped topping slide problem bit, yeah big fan crust thin. For NY style though, got pat, that's 3 stars. Plus I respect joint lot. :)
I second bowl pho Pittsburgh here, although better first bowl, still pretty disappointing. The broth everything pho. Pho broth takes like nine hours make. The broth Pho Minh bland almost clear color. Good broth dark pungent, like watered chicken broth. I combination beef tripe pho, literally five small pieces beef there. I guess since much competition Vietnamese food, $8 price tag valid, even though that's much I normally pay good pho elsewhere. We also ordered deep fried spring rolls, disappointment too. Mine also still cold center, I guess frozen beforehand.
Tram's Kitchen closed, girlfriend I went street Pho Minh instead. Here gripes: - Food WAY salty (ie. bloated like hell next day) - Restaurant WAY quiet (they need turn radio something!) - Service slow (or often forgot simple requests like water, etc.) I credit spring rolls though... sweet little man runs cash register! (I think he's Minh's husband?)
I probably should've tried pho unfortunately I got lemongrass beef rice I impressed. In fact I quite disappointed. It also seemed expensive ($8) quantity quality dish. Based reviews, probably safe stick pho.
Pho restaurant close West Penn Hospital, I've lot better soup base, I would say sub par Pho comparing California. Nonetheless, fufills average standards. Also tofu spring roll, alright. Nothing special place, typical mom pop Vietnamese noodle place locals.
Dr. Bebko Bloomfield Cat Clinic fantastic! I started taking cat Taro year ago, disappointing experience Animal Rescue League vet. There needs movie made Dr. Bebko, elusive Pittsburgh Cat Whisperer! He truly cares much cats - I never worry negligence detail visit. For instance, Taro gets shots vaccines here, I notice Dr. Bebko administers parts body least nerve endings (like nape neck). While seems obvious, I (and I, I mean Taro) definitely appreciate attention detail. It seems Taro's never TARO-fied go vet anymore! While I haven't much experience rest staff, seem relatively polite. The prices definitely bit higher vets I've seen, I don't mind much since Dr. Bebko good.
Wow! Talk attitude phone! After glowing reviews I read on-line, I decided call place schedule appointment cat issues lately. Due work schedule, I requested Saturday appointment told don't take new clients Saturdays. When I explained situation, I told rules clinic exceptions. I asked late hours latest appointment 6 PM. I work 6PM. I asked early morning appointments told begin see patients 10 AM. I start work 9 AM. I told I take day bring cat exam. When I expressed frustration, I told, "Well, I'm sorry. We reserve Saturdays existing clients only." I replied I would client willing accommodate me. I got snippy, "Well, I'm sorry." Never mind! I don't need receive attitude receptionist. Clearly, don't need business.
I brought little kitty Molly year ago impressed Cat Clinic! I feel vets know lot dogs little cats, needless say, Cat Clinic different. We trouble Molly cat getting along, doctor gave helpful advice.I would definitely come back again.
I brought sick kitty vomitting diahhrea days Dr saw like "so want do" I thinking well thats I ask professional advise. I felt like I spent $100 absolutely nothing. I would recommend clinic legit issues, I sure fine vaccination routine check I would never allow treat one sick babies. I taken lil girl AVETS clinic holiday stabilized asked us F/U primary Vet (clearly something significant going on), visit I total sham I felt useless I found new Vet care lil ones.
It began I discovered 4 tiny, goopy eyed baby kittens garage. Their eye respiratory infections clearly very, bad. We called Cat Clinic, talked us options regarding kittens (ie leaving are, bringing vet putting back mother attempting give medications, bringing indoors, etc). They allowed us bring 4 once, gave us complete instructions caring 4 3-4 week old kittens. We Cat Clinic almost weekly tracking progress first month. They amazing, remembered kittens names (which isn't easy) cost reasonable. Now house ran 4 crazy brothers, still go Cat Clinic. If I ever bring one boys anything, always ask 3. In fact, one boys FVR I bring alone antibiotics pretty terrible flair up. I recently taken one brothers PVSEC broken leg. As soon I walked door employees asking broken leg kitty PVSEC sent records. Also, Cat Clinics guidance, FVR kitty one flair required antibiotics. Dr. Bebko knowledgeable, easy tell every employee real love cats. There one day I bring 4 yearly checkups vaccinations. One reception staff saw me, came help carry carriers I wouldn't leave two car make second trip. Also, one boys "tough skin" tricky get vaccine needle one shot. Dr. Bebko ask one assistants come back hold pet little guy administering shots make less traumatic him. It's also great bonus one scaredy cat doesn't sit waiting room filled dogs, stresses great deal. I couldn't imagine taking boys anywhere else.
Worst service ever!!! We party 10 reservation think care reservation? Heck no!!! Waited table hour!!!! No body came check us, waiting empty table, apologies, ask table, really mean rude, hostess job ended kicking us upset impatient were, no.... I think anyone would upset waiting reservation long. Worst experience ever!!! Will defiantly go again!!
I'll second reviewer said price charged, amount food receive doesn't measure up. Furthermore, Pittsburgh still yet quality schawarma. I ordered beef chicken schawarma sample. The beef: - clearly frozen boxed 'steak-ums' opposed freshly shaved doner. - measly 2 slices that, I basically wrap lettuce tomato w/ hint beef The chicken: - clearly frozen somewhat freezer burnt sliced chicken breast opposed freshly sliced doner mix white dark meat. leaves meat dry tasteless. - maybe half chicken breast I lucky No toum similar sauce served either dish?!?! That's hitting whole new low fake schawarma. Hostess great, service adequate. I motivation return. Hopefully one day Pittsburgh good choices comes Greek Med. food. Today day.
I high hopes. And though clearly pride pasta ravioli, mine fell apart like crazy. It mess. An expensive mess. Artichoke Gorgonzola everywhere. Not seams fell apart. The pasta broke over. I may go back tiramisu time, I'll definitely hesitate spending 9 bucks dozen pieces watery mess again.
Eating Armand's fish sandwich become white whale, like ahab I'm cursed misfortune. Everytime I've tried go closed. You would think restaurant back bar would open 7.30pm. Hah you'd mistaken.. One days Armand's. I taste fish sandwich. One days. I swear.
There simply way describe Armand's fish sandwich without taking Lord's name vain. It's like that, see.
Armand's usually dirty. It smoky, filthy. The ladies bathroom embodies everything I hate bathroom - toilet close wall, sink push-button knobs, air-hand dryer, door opens wrong way. The patrons occasionally rowdy, sometimes hostile. I (more once) gotten fight straight people gay I am. In fairness, may totally necessary discuss lesbian oral sex techniques loudly 4th pitcher beer night, except *totally is.* Regardless, typical Pittsburgh Y*nzer filthy bar, stand-in us miss Dukes, cheaper dirt, staffed wild rogues hearts gold, maintaining totally erratic hours. No, I never eaten fish sandwich. I don't eat animal flesh, I can't tell it's good claim.
Right heart Bloomfield you'll find Armand's: The Home Giant Monster Fish Sandwich... While I can't say anything fish sandwich, home cheapest PBR pounder 6 packs ever. The bar small, would considered cozy-dive bar patrons weren't smoking like chimneys. If ever one thing lead never frequent bar it's smoke. I've left 5 minutes buying pounders go home smelled badly I change clothes...
Yes, fish good. However, restaurant dirty, bathroom smelled awful I could go it. The waitress RUDE, CRUDE, downright OBNOXIOUS!!!! Was fish good enough ever go back - NEVER!!!!!!!!
After 45 minute wait, communication, standing inhaling cigarette smoke like you've never seen/smelled before, gave order. We tried get give us money back, even one piece fish half order food all, became irate. (I told lady couldn't wait anymore......she turned back me). The food looked good whenever could get out. I think surprised people going come......on Friday.......during Lent......for fish........ They clearly overwhelmed. It like blind leading blind. I hope take $20 donation invest someone help get organized. Never. Again.
Just got back trying lunch buffet Taste India, pretty good definite value. It $7.95/person includes drink - soda, mango juice mango lassi. The buffet usual chutneys raitas, naan, vegetable pakoras, fresh fruit (mostly watermelon), salad, chicken fried rice plain basmati rice, 3 chicken dishes 3 veggie dishes. Today tandoori chicken, chicken tikka masala plain old chicken curry, channa masala, alu palak, alu green beans. There also gulab jamuns. My favorite definitely alu green beans, disappointingly menu. The chickpeas good, I thought alu palak disappointing. (I generally disappointed palak paneer restaurants since I awesome recipe I make home time.) The watermelon chunks awesome palate cleanser, gulab jamuns great. Total two people came $17 tip. This nice little place, lunch almost everyone Children's Hospital staff. Parking little hard find since residential streets permit only. But I really like place it's definitely worth it.
5:30pm, worst Baingan Bartha I've ever had. Un-fresh damn near flavorless powdery heat. Please invest fresh chillies; keep well make "8" really pop flavor.
The food terrible. We spent $100 two us. Don't eat fish/seafood. Got food poisoning meals. If I could give zero stars I would. Regretting going dinner tonight. Threw I got home. Now ends. Ugh. We sick. Food poisoning. Beware!!!!! Terrible food. DO NOT EAT HERE!!!! Disgusting food. This third try here. First great. Second ok. Third terrible. The entrees horrible. The apps good don't eat dinner you'll regret it. So sick right now. Never going back.
This used one favorite restaurants. We heard gone hill. Last night tried found indeed has. Way down. I ordered Greek Chicken. All I could taste lemon. They must changed pita suppliers. The new pitas tasted like doughy pancake. My wife's dinner bland. We gift card still another 5 dollars I'm sure we'll even use it. It bad. My hope fix problems. It used great.
Jordan & I eating Taste India CMU while, without knowing Taste India. At CMU offer super inexpensive lunches filling anywhere else eat lunch. During winter break, going serious withdraw cafe closed. Thank YELPERS again, search satiate curry addiction, found distributor! We excited read restaurant supplied weekly lunches ordered!! I ordered Alu Matar Mushroom spicy rating 3 (yes, I'm sissy), EXACTLY I wanted!! Jordan ordered Alu Gobhi cauliflower & potato spicy rating 5. We truly weren't sure scale tolerance; decided next time could go hotter. We also can't wait try Lunch Buffet! We really wish would known existed week Christmas & New Years fiending Indian food. Now know, I doubt soon become regulars. We also tried Tamarind Oakland, place made mouth go numb said done (and left unpleasant digestion experience). All bad cliche things hear Indian food, nothing like Taste India. You taste love cooked in.
I tried eat tonight using $25 gift certificate purchased Restaurant.com. After waiting 15 minutes server stop order, I showed gift certificate. She told stopped taking them, however I purchased 15 minutes earlier. I spoke manager wasn't least bit interested. He told Restaurant.com scam (I used problems) hasn't able get touch cancel. While I still talking him, answered call cell phone without even saying excuse me. He obviously didn't care all. I called Restaurant.com refund, told said. They told actually trying get touch restaurant weeks. I assume owes money something. Either way, outrageous honor gift certificate program agreed sign for. Beyond problem, I can't recommend place simply based awfully dealt issue. I didn't get chance try food I never will.
This place terrible. Pittsburgh know make food correct, let alone complexity Indian cuisine. This city dumpster eastern U.S. Do go here, ever go Pittsburgh.
If really know like Indian cuisine food gonna flavorless bland you. Tandoori chicken doesn't taste like one etc. Decor tasteless old. Carpet looks really dirty. I'm definitely coming back.
Just dinner there. We started Pakora I chicken biryani fiance got tandoori mixed grill. We got paneer naan garlic roti. The Pakora came well portioned price right $4. Plenty eat plum sauce good. Chicken biryani perfect. Gigantic portion customized spicy level 6 I asked for. Ended taking half home. Tandoori mixed grill big portion tasty chicken little dry. Next time hoping order something like curry eat rice came dish. Everything tasty portions ample sized . Wish I room dessert. Will definitely coming back eat get carry soon.
I rated 4 stars husband. He loves place orders take pretty often. Last time decided stay inside I wanted taste spicy dish. Usually I don`t eat spicy food I often suffer stomachaches. But sometimes I crave much time. I asked "4" (scale spiciness 1 10). For non-indian people 4 suppose mean it`s slightly spicy, less medium. That idea head. But I got mango chicken I could barely taste it. It sooooo spicy. I felt like dragon. For 8 even 9. I able finishing food. And didn`t even think enjoying it:(((( Why ask want food 2 option - spicy super hot spicy?
I place weekend fried family. We expected authentic Indian style food. We ordered chicken biriyani, lamb biriyani, peas pulav Chicken Pakora, Gulab jam. Biriyani awful it's taste less. Full racines. This restaurants definitely South Indians. Maintainance service good food completely tasteless. Chicken pakora best. Papad awesome. On Biriyani pees pulav Wasted money.
We always happy food Amel's however waitstaff could better attitude. They seem unhappy jobs. Also place needs renovations. The carpeting worn looks dirty booths needs new stuffing need reupholstered. You would think money place makes would shell money basic upkeep.
If like wait hour 17 minutes fish sandwich fries, squished like sardines, like old outdated decor 70's, place! Avoid costs.
Finding good Indian restaurant always challenge. Taste India certainly decent...nothing nothing less. Figuring optimal day/time hit lunch buffet like trying find Gujarat map. It's really hard, you're usually wrong first times. That's main complaint TOI, somedays food really good, days it's downright criminal. I think I've figured system trying explain would like.....never mind, get picture.
I went walk-in random Wednesday. Tom busy, squeezed in. In 15 minutes little direction I tighest fade side Mississippi. It pretty neat watch work. He's truly master I regret every dollar I've ever spent bargain "value" chains stylists typically revolving door mediocrity. I challenge find better cut $14.
Needed haircut really bad Saturday afternoon I decided give place try. No appointment, walked in. As I learned people walking out, barber's name Tom, older gentleman Italian accent. He's def old country. Very friendly dude funny personality. The wait half hour, isn't bad walk Saturday afternoon (I've waited barber shops hour half walking in). As actual hair cut, I'm really satisfied it. Tom quick efficient. I could tell he's cutting hair long time way works. Real quality stuff. I like fact uses straight razor neckline. No lie, probably one best hair cuts I've gotten while. I def back see Tom next time I need hair cut.
They always provided family honest, professional service fair price. My father went years ago car serious issues limited funds address them. They worked gave several options get car back road within budget. I concur poster guys straightforward play games try add unnecessary charges bill. My wife loyal auto repair business ever used mechanics treat like idiot woman. Would definitely recommend!
As I stated , I don't review chain restaurants unless something outstanding horrible . Well , place beyond horrible . If I could give negative stars I would . The food typical McDonalds . Not good bad . The service , however , terrible . As I placed order , greeting I got " want " . The woman waited obviously didn't finish sixth grade didn't care manners . She slow molasses even though several people line behind . After taking time BS coworker weekend , gave order never said " thankyou" . I replied " welcome " loudly make point got mean stare return . I asked speak manager told busy next 15 minutes . I left I driving away , I saw manager two workers grabbing smoke near rear door . No wonder service horrible !!! Will never stop .
I go fast food places times year, best, maybe expectations little skewed, latest experience McDonald's left lot desired. There's really use rating actual food, it's hard screw food McDonald's. It's subpar grub, penchant getting filet-o-fish sandwiches time year lives anyway, I go satiate once-a-year craving. My issue service. I walked employees chatting friends off-hours coworkers customer side counter. It around 11pm lack customers inside restaurant made pretty obvious I person waiting order taken, didn't stop employees behind counter finishing conversations taking order. After I finally put order in, I seemed wait eternity (in fast food terms) two filet-o-fish sandwiches, regular McBites, medium french fry order. It hardly complicated order, I've waited less time peak hours fast food chains past. Thankfully, ONE girl working saw standing long time, asked, "are McBites yet?...where they?" I happy someone finally addressed situation, shouldn't taken long. Again, I'm aware showing 11pm probably increase odds walking late-night, preparing-for-the-next-day mess restaurant, even fast food, it's absurd think level cleanliness I walked acceptable. Not mention, one girl working announcing "going pee" I standing there. I wasn't offended all, I found odd thought acceptable say front customer. I guess experience reminded I limit trips fast food chains much possible.
Horrible, rude service. 12 minute wait fast food?!?!
After terrible morning rainy day, I sort lost cool store stormed without food. I sat car fuming (over something stupid) I suspect supervisor walked brought food, look care compassion eyes made feel bad idiot. It small gesture meant much. Thank you.
Let's say, fast food definitely NOT place !! Service horrible, really could care less get order timely manner. Stay away !!!!
shame, nice stuff store, owner Steve whack job. made feel uncomfortable, kinda nasty condescending. don't know bad day always is, I don't need treated way, especially I'm spending good money.
I walked place to-go order. The joint busy, worth wait -about 30 minutes. Very comfy waiting area main dining room. The Hunan Chicken spicy without salty & eggrolls crisp greasy. Only negative I'd give hostess, bit snarky I ordered, I'll give leeway based crowd there. I'd go again.
Friends I looking order Chinese food Sunday afternoon. Unfortunately, Sesame Inn doesn't deliver 4pm. They're prices little expensive Chinese places I've quantity food less well. Quality food ordered find though ready pick-up arrived. Unless I really craving Chinese food, I'd probably go somewhere else.
If you're seeking bland, salty, Chinese food every entree tastes exactly other...this place!
This simple... The karaoke limited selection. The DJ kept fiddling volume singing. Was way over-crowded wanna-be hipsters attempting ironic made look pathetic, especially since kept taking pictures likely show Facebook people much fun great are. There one server bar packed people hard get drink. Won't going back.
This first yelp review. I set account review. I deeply sadden food I received today. I first started coming since 1993. I moved Midwest four years later. However, every times I drive thru Pittsburgh,I always stopped here. I really enjoy general Tso' chicken. As part preparation, chicken fried ahead time,and fried order, That general Tso's Chicken crispy aromatic served. I make stop, driving 450 miles, I wanted decent meal. Well, I stopped order Dish carry out. When I open them(it long, 30 minutes less), soggy, based experience grew Chinese food, fried second time. The difference? They tasted worse Buffet dish sitting steamer hours. Furthermore, I ordered shrimp garlic sauce. Shrimp hard chew. It seems like shrimp simmered sauce ages. There aroma garlic onion. Being decent cook myself, I tell dishes I ordered cooked main chef, secondary chef. I suspect probably made guy station fryer. Truly, taste two dishes awful, I toss out. I purchase passing Pittsburgh, really possible asking refund. I much memory place. Rest assured, I won't coming ever. It bad, I would dear try again. I hope owner sees this, make statement incident. I eager see standby dishes again. If I see owner's rebuttal, I would love call owner discuss encounter further, willing convinced come back. Sincerely
The oil sauce ratio Kung pao chicken 1:1 - maybe worse. I couldn't eat it. I literally rinse hot water order salvage bites. This isn't first time I problem here. Takeout gross. I won't back.
Wow. Just wow. Simply put, food sesame inn absolutely fantastic. If I say myself, need try general tso's chicken steamed rice - combo! Food place gets 5 stars. However, restaurant gets 4 stars. This waitress little mean friends. She told us "not say thank much" also showed bit. She carried 10 plates one hand could carried maybe 5 made two trips. This obviously done show us trust I say buying act. Anyway, show left let us enjoy meal, perfect. I definitely back soon think upping review 5 stars none staff tries impress us hard.
I use love restaurant today. It last time, I ever stop again. Stopped daughter wanted something small eat. We order two egg roll sushi slit. We told order food totaling $10.00 person could eat restaurant. I left disappointed.
I customer sesame inn many, many years. Growing Mount Lebanon, parents always ordered since I moved back 11 years ago ,I ordered least week family. A couple weeks ago I house full people ordered $100 worth food delivery. I sorry report tiny brown bugs ALIVE AND MOVING chicken fried rice. Myself six adults hallucinating, actually food. The kids eaten us notice sat eat. I called way situation handled absolutely unbelievable.they told I put bugs bag. We left bugs rice returned food. They claimed didn't see any. Seeing though I regular customer never complained, I could believe would refund money food unable consume. I NEVER ORDER feom sesame Inn Again. Totally disgusting..I worked restaurant business many years none managers would handled situation poorly have. Despicable disgusting.
So apparently business listed twice different names address closing time wrong sites. I called inquire closing Time. The lady said close 945?? Two stars seem able get together.
So finished meal family I go back! The waitress I don't know name never shared polite efficient. The redeeming quality I found meal 2 glasses wine! Not food bad wasn't good! I ordered Moo Shoo Pork 4 "Chinese" pancakes. Once arrived I looking forward main dish looked appetizing. Then I opened "Chinese" pancakes... OMG served steamed tortillas! I expecting crepe style Chinese pancakes instead I flour tortillas steamed!!! Growing moved Pittsburgh West Coast I KNOW tortilla I'm served one wasn't even handmade freshly cooked tortillas get chain joint like Chevy's pull em bag Giant Eagle tortilla! This killed meal $100.00+ tab came I aghast! My wife two kiddos decent meals serve large portions doesn't mean you're serving 100 dollars worth food! I felts cheated high prices mediocre chinese (notice little C) food place used rated great Chinese restaurant back 1996 plaques wall gleefully point out; seem notice way out!
I actually surprised whenever I checked China Gate lower average rating. I curious meal going I've bad Chinese before. My friend Brandi & I painting twist Galleria mall's art week. She China Gate explained cute was, agreed eat here. The restaurant upstairs loft-like area Galleria see mall here. My friend I weren't extremely hungry noticed plates pretty large, decided split plate general tso's. We also ordered white rice side egg rolls appetizers. No complaints food. It wasn't bad all. The spotty thing track server water refill water empty awhile people restaurant. Other (which honestly isn't big deal all) satisfying, Oh, also full bar [thumbs emoji]
We eat lot love Chinese, place gone years excellent OK bad. Tonight worst experience long time. The waitress arrived promptly, took drink orders, disappeared 30 minutes, finally showing wine, water (for ask three times!). After another quarter hour, shows again, takes order, reappearing another quarter hour one entrées, appetizers. She takes back entrée five minutes later brings egg roll soup (but still water!). Then brings entrées, one one I sent back (it even reheated! ) another one husband ordered. Finally, get correct one, also bit cool side. Then ask rice, arrivé fairly promptly. It took nearly half hour get bill, wrong (we undercharged one glass wine). So, paid bill, including missing wine left, two half hours arrived. The restaurant understaffed, poorly managed, staff badly trained. Too bad. Several years ago, wonderful.
bridesmaid recently bride got dress here. bride everything went perfect. brides maids freaking disaster. first dresses ridiculously expensive towner call measurements, woman took measurements rude recommended get size 14! I'm 4!! even telling wouldn't let get anything less 12! came time dress shipped woman took address wrote wrong fed ex lost it! new dress sent speedily one offered refund s&h! finally got dress swimming it!!! went look receipt rude comments written argumentative shy size!!! rush dress tailor, ladies said thing one got her's altered shop said charged $100 dress taken 2 sizes! short women rude poor customer service completely priced!! bride don't want headache bridesmaids ladies go somewhere else!!!!
I never bought dress here, I ever plan buying experience I today. Two half weeks ago I googled bridal dress alterations BB popped search. It near house fiance said popular place, I figured I would give call. The woman phone asked several questions dress said could fit in. I little weary appointment two half weeks since I didnt much time I getting plane Bora Bora (and knew date I needed by). I figured knew doing, I became excited day go get fitted me. I went in, dress shoes hand prepared try fit body. It needed let bit around rib cage shortened... nothing difficult. The woman desk asked could help I said I appointment dress alteration. She looked book searching name... two woman came one asked I gotten dress know I could see I purchased dress didnt phone number (Funny, I remember leaving phone number I made appointment... doesn't make im. She stated "We alterations dresses bought here". I told woman I never told that, ad said well person made appointment told that.... WELL GUESS WHAT!!!! She not!!!! And wasted two half weeks already short time frame. SHe stated would go ask see something could done. Of course came back stated sorry, cannot help me. I course stood telling fault I told ever. WHy would I waste two half weeks already small time frame. Bottom line three woman stood staring refused even make exception. You messed up, me... good customer service make exception. They course could care less me. They even offer give local seamstress thought I could possibly use. I HAD TO ASK IF THEY RECOMMENDED SOMEONE!!!! What horrible service place gives! Thankfully woman ended giving FANTASTIC... Ss glad I found her. She getting dress done week, probably ALOT quicker BB would. I rather bothered customer service I given, could handled situation ALOT different. I actually planning buying second wedding dress there, experience I would rather give business elsewhere. I downing dresses BB customer service may given actually already bought dress there.... I merely telling customer service I given. Just I didnt buy dress mean dismiss me.... You look people future customers future referrals.
So, I'm matron. We bridesmaids dresses. The selection unique, though plenty dresses. Despite appointment, associate working another group (which fine) woman assigned us totally clueless. I hadn't read reviews prior going (wish I had), would likely purchased dress I had, I anticipate what's come us. We encouraged buy dresses MUCH larger sizes. I hard time believing anything size larger measurements would needed. It actually recommended I buy 5 sizes up, I debate associate budge. I mention upcharge certain size (14 16, I can't remember, UC may every size thereafter). Throughout, kept telling me, "It's easier make alterations large dress". I get that, I don't think 5 sizes necessary based actual physical measurements. It seems ridiculous, actually. What clear alterations "a large dress" would cost money. In fact, every time question came up, answer avoided flustered conversation. And I'm quite sure, based reviews, expected alterations extremely costly addition $250+ bridesmaid dress. We waited nearly hour associate spoke whomever overseeing make sure "everything perfect" five women. The bride actually went upstairs find socializing sat downstairs waiting. In addition, knowledge associate lackluster. The dressing rooms downstairs awkward, without privacy, left nowhere put belongings floor. I'm certain taking dress family friend seamstress avoid much anticipated costs "altering" large dresses, sorry BB, you'll get money us. Buyer beware. It's different hear (unnamed) places nickel dime small costs seemingly try upcharge things may necessary, though I won't able say certainty dresses come in. Stay tuned.
I love place! I 3 pairs shoes needed fixed BAD, 2 bad I haven't worn year so. They heels heels missing rubber bottoms material heel ripped worn. I never used shoe repair place I'd hate spend money new shoes. The guy, I'm assuming owner, nice. He even made sure get done 3 days I left vacation normally would take week. For $40 I got 3 pairs shoes fixed cost almost $300. I always prefer fix things possible rather replacing them, I definitely back ANY shoe needs! The worse pair I black heel boots look brand new again!! Very happy girl!
I don't get it, pizza I priced soggy mess burnt crust. The oven way hot type pizza.
Well I oven roasted pizza's NYC SF. So I expected much better... Our pizza burnt. After finally got blonde waitresses attention . We showed black bottom. It tasted like charcoal. We Caesar salads so-so. But told server could eat burnt pizza. To surprise don't take pizza check.....it's policy. So pay pizza could eat. We never go back!!!
After visiting Donatelli's today part Yelp Event, husband I returned purchase Cheese Ravioli, Grandma's Plain Sauce, Chocolate-Covered Almond Biscotti dinner. After tried three evening, I definitely recommend Donatelli's food look forward items again!
I love store gone often past years, however, lately lady behind deli counter total b**ch I come in. The last time I came tried use coupon I printed web page, yelled told I couldn't use unless I bought pound lunch meat. Fine, although coupon doesn't say that, that's okay. I wasn't rude back, glared rest time I there. When I went recently, one store someone back making sandwiches me. Another employee asked could help (I wanted get lunch meat I waited), quickly said, "No, she's already waited on", glared again. Fine, another lady partially order, asked her, "is anything else I get wait stuff?". Really? As I've worked customer service too, I never rude demanding employees. What wrong lady? Seriously? Maybe next time I'll go somewhere else.
I RUSHED tan today work. I got Yolanda's 7:20PM, find salon closed. Both sign door listed hours website state Yolanda's tanning side open 8pm. I'm pretty pissed I wasted time driving whole way Monroeville Bloomfield nothing. I've spent money (multiple) tanning packages here, I definitely taking sad, untanned booty somewhere reliable on.
Damicos closed since December 2012
If looking good Pho Pittsburgh Tram's Kitchen place go. The broth pho quite flavorful can't go wrong ordering bowl nice cold day.
Why many people Pittsburgh love place? The day someone asked me... where's favourite Vietnamese food? I told I didn't know favourite, I could tell least favourite: Tram's. I don't even care decor seating etc. Usually best Vietnamese comes fairly sketchy looking joints. I "Special" noodle bowl version Bun thit nuong. It looked mess. The spring rolls cut brutally everything tossed in. Usually order place, doesn't come "pre-mixed." Honestly, looked like someone already starting eating this. I thought myself... "Okay different presentation style." But I ate, I even disappointed. They hardly put fresh vegetables it, vermicelli overcooked. The spring rolls completely soggy. I don't think menu limited though, seemed fairly typical. I don't know, maybe Pho better, I'm already disappointed come back. After reading people's reviews trying Vietnamese places around city Vietnamese food Toronto(at average place), I'm throughly convinced people city idea Vietnamese food supposed taste like. Oh one last thing... actually believe food vegetarian? I guess joke's you.
Wow! I glad Miss Alison suggested place town. She's vegan plenty options her. We came friends dinner Day 1 selling Handmade Arcade. We got time since got packed shortly sat down. There slight language barrier, instead getting chicken crispy noodles, I got tofu, know what? I didn't even notice 5 minutes eating I looked across table friend Jessica's dish clearly chicken ordered thing. Oh well. I don't regret all. It delicious I ate every bite. Also vegetable gyoza started tasty. Will definitely add rotation Pittsburghian restaurants I hit I there. I heart Pittsburgh!
Pittsburgh doesn't many Vietnamese options. Tram's Kitchen place I've ever heard people mentioning. Today I've finally visited it. First impression: solid pho. The soup good flavor, though portion little small. I disappointed tripe tendon, beef cut thinly. The menu selection terribly wide, seem least competent offer. Efficient family service. Simple ambiance. Dinner $15.
If PHO restaurant, city, Tram's Kitchen would OUT OF BUSINESS! For starters, portion PHO extremely SKIMPY! I don't think small portion PHO since Babies! Seriously, would kill add rice noodles? Since PHO Appetizers, ordered Seafood Pan Fried Noodles...Oh wait...we paid Seafood...but got vegetables imitation call seafood. What Joke! Suggestion plan going here. Come FULL order Spring Roll.
I'm Vietnamese I grew eating Vietnamese food everyday. Let tell you, place big let down. I don't know people giving rave reviews. All Viet friends city also avoid place really NOT good. The portions tiny, pho broth leaves unsatisfied. It lacks true flavor pho broth have. I've pho home 30+ different pho restaurants probably top 5 disappointing. As dishes, comes table looking like someone already ate like jumbled mess. This aside service..I actually like old man works there...he's reason I give two stars.
I feel I must defend Tram's... Point one: It's dirty. So it's freakin' Panera Bread there... 7 high school students wiping tables times. It's super clean, what? Please name spotlessly clean Vietnamese restaurant city Pittsburgh. Seriously, take spin alley behind Pho Minh Garfield, *ahem* sorry Penn Avenue Arts District... Their backyard like open sewer... I've still eaten lived tell tale. Point two: But hipsters, would business. Don't give much credit, friends. In ancient era B.C.H. (Before Coming Hipsters), Tram's still brisk business serving tasty basic Pittsburgh-Vietnamese cuisine (they've taken shimp curry french fries menu, still order it) would brave wilds Lawrenceville (a distinctly unfashionable address, circa 1995) get it. Did Tram's corner market time? Sure. Would people return terrible? I would hope not. As food, I student Vietnamese cuisine, bun, it's billed here: "grilled meat (why don't call pork mystery, perhaps they're leaving options open?) vermicelli" (pronounced "ver-miss-eh-lee," esteemed host) tasty filling, spring rolls. I can't comment pho I many inedible-mystery-tendon experiences "real" Vietnamese restaurants "real" cites "really" excited dish... Long lives Tram's! Haters beware....
I didn't care much atmosphere hole wall sort restaurant authentic & non-Americanized (which I'm looking for). Location restaurant run (kind Old Pittsburgh style) parallel parking must, aware may park far walk restaurant you're able get front door service. Inside I didn't expect much, tablecloths vinyl chairs uneven stands. All I care authenticity food & cost it's worth. I started meal appetizer Goi Cuon shrimp. I highly disappointing disecting it. There 1 shrimp cut half lengthwise, mainly bun (rice noodle) fillers along strands beansprouts & lettuce make look presentable. I quickly devoured tiny appetizer 2 bites. My main entree Pho Ha Noi. It took forever food arrive, big bowl. Until I stirred around find mainly broth green onions. The broth flavorless, actually didn't flavor; I add hoisin sause give little whatever go along sliced pork. I confused noodle itself, Pho usually served flat vermicelli noodle; Pho Ha Noi served round vermicelli noodles usually Bun Bo entree. I asked old man amputated arm, served bun (round rice noodle) instead pho (flat rice noodle) noodles, laughed insisted pho (flat rice noodle). Ok I may young I wasnt born yesterday, I think I know pho noodle sorry wasn't. Next visit 'burgh, I think I'll try Pho Minh & see PHO compares Tram's Kitchen. So HIGHLY disappointed Pho experience.
Only I ordered Pho Hanoi; I would say even though Pho Hanoi noticeably less ingredients Pho Minh, chicken absolutely best chicken I've -- probably chicken breast -- opposed usual chicken "unknown parts" one usually gets Chinese Vietnamese restaurants ....
Although everyone comes pho, also like fried rice egg noodles tofu yummy! yummy!
I don't know reviewers compare Trams Pho Minh. Pho Minh disgusting uses tasteless powder broth/soup base pho. Pho Minh lot closer real deal, pho selection really small. This best bowl pho I've Pittsburgh, four stars totally relative 'burgh.
I Pho I can't judge rest food, Pho worst I've ever had. Biggest let ever, I drove closed came back excited get fill Pho what's apparently best place Pittsburgh, left feeling sad. The broth tasted like water, amount beef noodles get pathetic.
Just wanted briefly point Seth M. waiter one arm Tram's father. I told sister-in-law befriended long time ago family sided American's Vietnam war (perhaps explains arm, I'm sure). Most family took refuge states, reason (not certain why) daughter, Tram, detained Vietnam rest family trekked States. He opened Tram's kitchen then, eventually, Tram reunited family states. Last I there, two servers Tram's father (wish I knew name) Tram, father/daughter server team.
Great pho. Small, vegetarian friendly boring. Go there!
I always held place high regard, super cute always delicious bf I couple friends went couple weeks ago I extremely disappointed. I'm vegan bf already limited choices, Napoli antipasto awesome entree left much desired. I forget exact name basically spaghetti w pomodoro sauce. I can't believe charge $16 dish! It cold good portion. I got huge hot pepper burnt crap lip. I love spicy stuff too! Just good value $. I moved back nyc fav place charges significantly less significantly more. I'm disappointed bc one go places Pgh! :/
Ok...so, it's difficult give star rating I mixed experience. The caesar salad one BEST I ever had, pizza one, worst I ever had. I ordered margarita, sauce, cheese basil. Well I think may run cheese basil. It wet tasteless mess. I may return craving good caesar.
Poor service, incapable hostesses, undercooked pizza, undercooked pasta, weak version eggplant parm, beverage ordered never arrived. No domestic wines cabernet chardonnay menu; don't make good wines CA? Other Mrs. Lincoln, enjoy play? Friday night apparently night go.
Heard GREAT things place. What let was. Made reservations Anniversary showed time. Early evening Friday night. We ordered ravioli personal pizza.......it took 47 MINUTES food come !!! I counting. Because rediculous. The restaraunt half empty, sat 47 minutes little bread oil--wich refilled twice food taking long. AND NEVER refilled empty water glasses. I decided 50 minutes leaving. Lo behold 47 minutes comes out. Bland soggy we've ever tasted. Opposite expected "upscale" Italian dining experience. They never apologized long wait food pretended everything normal fine. We scarfed hurry leave asked bill. The waitress put table took almost 10 minutes return charge obviously packed ready go. We walked register someone else nearby handle us. My husband went pull car around I finished bill. Look, I know first world problems, truthfully, husband I always enjoy others company much hardly notice long wait food... PLUS... gift card.... But trying make show night ended arriving late meal kinda sucked. Even worse, husband I got leave, table 2 next us received food---- seated 15 minutes earlier!!!! I never complain waitstaff mostly I used waitress, pushed far get yelp I witnessed way door. While I standing door waiting charge card, A elderly woman I noticed standing long time, asked hostess..."how much longer table?" hostess said..."About 20 minutes". The elderly woman replied.."Thats said 20 minutes ago, I see 5 empty tables." The hostess got rude retorted "Ma'am, people plan ahead make reservations, impossible tell exact amount time need wait dont know much longer people staying. They might order dessert, drinks. You go another establishment." Seeing old woman I would grandmother, I stuck neck spoke hostess. I said..."Listen, I've noticed woman standing long time. You don't chairs people sit wait, shes standing here. If told wait going 20 minutes, need seat 20 minutes. If were'nt sure exactly long wait would be, told first place instead getting angry going YOU SAID. Also, would'nt hurt show little respect elders." The hostess looked friend rolled eyes sarcasticly say..."who bi***?" hahahaha. VERY RUDE. VERY. WORST SERVICE IN YEARS. SORRY. Dishonorable staff. Unimpressive food.
This used one absolute favorite places eat. However I horrible service last outing I NEVER return again. The server rude ungrateful. She reminded Lindsay Lohan filming reality show. The atmosphere wine bar fabulous food decent. I really like pizza marinated vegetables. The meatballs also excellent. Sadly I cannot support business provides poor service.
They longer cut pizza you. Instead, give yiu "pizza knife". Trust I say barely better butter knife. The server explained longer cut pizzas b/c makes crust go soggy quicker cut. I'm sorry, plain LAME! I guess I bring own!
Expensive worth it!
Don't go winter. Seriously. It's cold - like sit coat cold. The food wine great, front dining room miserable. So disappointed.
An hour half later still waiting food. Waitress hasn't checked us half hour. Would rate food, clue still waiting. Ridiculous.
I don't see hype. Bad service, bland food.
Went last weekend friends. Two us became violently ill food poisoning. Ordinarily, I would recommend spring rolls pho, course, since trip ER, I won't back again.
like Tram's food disappointed today find hand written sign door restaurant closed 3 days, reference problem Health Department.
Don't believe hype. Was Pittsburgh area one day decided try pho here. It toss Pho Minh here. I think I chose wrong. A rule thumb good ethnic restaurant swarming particular ethnic people. When I went, I saw non-Asians. Ordered pho mediocre forgettable. It taste flavorful authentic maybe that's available Pittsburgh. Another sour note, dropped spring rolls table. It first time I thought complimentary ate them. Later on, saw bill. WE DIDN'T EVEN ORDER THEM. They overpriced, worth it. Be careful drop food drinks table, bill afterwards even didn't order it.
I feel sad bump review Tram's down, considering I've going years. However, recently, underwent closure health code violations food since. A co-workers mine got food poisoning prior closure. After reopened, I went back food lackluster. The spring rolls still favorite town, Pho mighty disappointing. I hope improves.
I spicy prawns time I noticed chili sauce tasted lot like ketchup. I fan ketchup hell I understand using base chili sauce doesn't set well Vietnamese food I guess I undertand Pittsburgh Vietnamese...it make sense. I like resturant , forgot cash I swear owner blocked way exit I withdrew cash atm...Yeah I didn't like feeling much. Yes I would dine agian fact I plan tomorrow evening, I'll make sure I cash hand made feel like sort sneak thief!
I'm looking Pho I come home late night. A Pho I dream cold days. I official Pho place- Pho Bang NYC- it's obviously far away. So far I haven't phound pho I'm looking Pittsburgh. I persevere try places, it's hard live Pho Bang. The spring rolls good. So little boy took order.
If get past humble appearance, Tram's Kitchen best pho fresh spring rolls Pittsburgh. The restaurant, owned operated family Vietnamese immigrants left old country early 1990s, earth low key. The service primarily provided Tram's father, one hand somehow manages seat, take order, pour/refill water, brings food, clear table cash out. He moody times, I never found rude even bad busy day (he probably doesn't time slowpokes can't make mind). I would cut slack doesn't appear patient person world. Parking Lawrenceville iffy times, drive west blocks past Tram's usually many streetside spots. Cash only. BYOB.
First all, Tram's cited Allegheny Health Department code violations like storing meat proper temperatures. I also personally know several people gotten violently ill eating there. If that's enough stop you, read on. I feel like people like place confusing "dirty & mean" authentic. The staff unpleasant doesn't feel like place you'd want someone cooking food. And finally, sure, could different food good, opinion, not. Bland disappointing, Pho all. Pittsburgh many great asian restaurants, including Vietnamese options, I don't see reason eat here.
Very disappointed! Pho ok, bad. The pork chop rice horrible, worst Vietnam pork chop rice ever. I tried PHO restaurant NY, NJ, MD, VA, PA, NV. This worst. I never try again.
Maybe I'm spoiled good Vietnamese food terrible. The chicken pho mixture shredded white dark meat, noodles larger normal, basil fresh worst part flavorless broth. Also questionable tofu vegetarian spring rolls.
I'm Vietnamese, worse viet food ever! Beware, I don't know surviving Pittsburgh . One soups looked like curry suppose clear soup. Please save trouble, I'm really surprised 4 stars.
should've come back desert. When arrived banana cake coconut milk. You can't miss pho spring rolls here.
My husband I stayed Pittsburgh weeks wanted pho. I read good stuff disappointed. We Vietnamese food states worst. We ordered Pho hanoi mixed fried rice. Soup flavour seems excessive MSG. EGG roll fried rice greasy. Service friendly. We don't want go back.
A great mom pop hole wall. Very busy location. Parking little difficult due small streets.
Go food quality, said. The one-armed unintelligible waiter isn't bad, said. Well. Turns wasn't case. So decor vibe aspects establishment besides price awful, amazing viet food makes it. Right? Wrong. I've three times. Each time I tell I'm missing something everyone else isn't. Idk I care more. Rushed dining experience, terrible atmosphere, wobbly furniture, slow service, English, messed bills, good prices though, decently tasty food (yet much different viet food I've had). Wont back.
I used ignore ambience , service, run look. But even food good anymore . With options coming area I doubt go time soon. Sorry guys say like now.
What strange experience - I travel business walked asked see menu. The hostess wasn't friendly & I tried make light conversation weather... I'm sales always works. I thought must heard didn't respond? I asked seated - manager owner smile & without word pointed table. I read menu, decided I wanted, checked email, checked Facebook... waitress smile, greeting came asked I wanted something drink seemed disappointed I asked water. Terrible... I eat almost every night week. The food may good... It may even great, I can't get passed friendly part.
Is me, Tram's changing - good way? My husband I going many years. We typically order thing - fresh spring rolls sate soup - good. Lately, spring rolls taste made day earlier, loaded dried dark meat chicken(?), rather shrimp veggies past. Service less friendly. The entire restaurant could use thorough cleaning. What happened???
This little store, sells Italian (Irish, other) decor home-y things, ROCKS. Maria, owner, also cooking classes apartment upstairs. If I still lived Pittsburgh, I'd LIVE there.
Need send gift basket foodie ... buy local ... buy Merante's. While taking order quizzed recepient. Need general Italian basket true Italian basket .... big difference goodies. Highly recommend. They deliver. I never disappointed.
I think restaurant fits american taste. Because non american eat now, even though seats fully occupied It doesnt taste like actual japanese cuisine, chinese. And smell chinese food right second entering restaurant. The sushi even firmly made I saying food bad, actually alright But great interior place
With prices cheap, I expected bland sushi. But hey, it's Pittsburgh.
I've 2 AM, it's always flaming trainwreck experience. I've figure waitresses halfway house job, I've staff members apologize picking pieces steel wool green plastic scrubber food, I've witnessed armed robbery. The food decent, hours they're open. Try Tom's Diner Eat 'n Park instead. Heck, go grocery store instead.
I love place!! I'm sushi fan, I 2 words non-sushi eater: Hibachi chicken! Dip yummy shrimp sauce!
The food isn't something rave it's edible. I love fact offer fried green tomatoes grape leaves. I (C)Ritters late night munchies also happens Pittsburgh's finest come play. Never dull moment.
Great place go 3 hammered want food. Ritters takes cash service extremely terrible sometimes. However, open 24 hours serve breakfast. I think they've seen enough share drunken idiots like us they're used now. Oh. Did I mention open 24 hours. AWESOME!
At 2am weekend night, clientele colorful, service friendly food...well forget food. The food ranges mediocre bland. Just grateful colorful place go late night meal.
Any establishment that's open 24 hours gets bonus points book. It's firm opinion business serves customers walk-in basis open 24/7. I mean, yeah, there's circadian rhythm thing keeps every business graveyard shift, I'm sure we're couple decades away curing need sleep. Point is, Ritter's 24 hours, result it's standby ever since I moved town. The food Ritter's definitely better you'll get Denny's King's. It isn't top-shelf, artisan food, pretty good diner food. Ritter's also great place go hang friends late night, BS coffee you're feeling going bar blowing mad cash drinks. Or stopping you've already blown mad drink cash. The waitresses nice. The fellah usually rings us really rude least once. I think owner manager something, too. But I'm really sure. The place cash-only, too, sucks. However, fact they're cash-only leads really encouraging story place: one time ATM something wacky I thought I may charged without received cash. The waitress took name phone number, I thought get stop complaining, sure enough someone called next day gave run-down happened. I'd call good service. If it's late you're peckish, don't forget Ritter's open.
Worst food Pittsburgh. That's all. I twice, never choice, I tummy ache times. I think food boring. Don't get wrong, I problem non-gourmet food, Ritter's, "blah". It also unclean feel times seated look around. They cash also. That doesn't Pamelas, food oh delish. Here, wasting apetite food TONS rooms improvement.
I live Liberty Ave everyone kept telling I needed try place, 4 months I did. When wife I walked I thought, place doesn't look bad, actually kinda cool. WRONG! After seated probably took 5 minutes waitress come another 5 minutes coffee get table. Our food took 45 minutes, absolutely ridiculous standard breakfast, I though, everyone thinks place great, I guess I wait perfection. The food gets table, looks good, looks like breakfast, cold, well mine cold. So I'm sitting table, empty coffee, cold breakfast quite pissed off, situation I'm hungry. Finally 10-12 minutes waitress comes asks everything is, I tell food cold, I'm fine don't need another plate, already hour, placed go, ya know. When waitress brings bill doesn't tell took food off, says, I figured I would take food even though didn't ask (really? I to?). Wife's food hot, thought average breakfast. I never want go back, I will, I always give places another shot. Terribly slow service (server nice though, probably home college), food took forever. I doubt place puts cold food regular basis, place wouldn't packed highly regarded.
Love sushi here. You can't go wrong anything menu. There street parking, also parking garage across street.
Ordered 2 eggs potatoes $3.85...DEAL! I asked eggs scrambled came home fries toast. I know meal wasn't exciting really mess eggs, toast potatoes?!?! The eggs toast fine - something I could've made home. But home fries left something desired. They flavor - it's like someone boiled potatoes slapped pan served plate. I put salt pepper them, didn't really help - it's like potatoes determined tasteless. I ate forkfuls gave up. I came meeting morning wasn't crowded. Looked like regulars fairly low key. I could definitely see peeps come night out. I'm sure I'd make point go Ritters unless night I needed place open 24 hours. They CASH only!
I can't really give food review since I didn't order anything, reason I didn't order anything. My brother friends midnight munchies whole pub crawling. Being responsible little sister, I "chaperoned" boys went Ritters them. I wasn't mood eat midnight, that's reason I didn't order anything. The reason I didn't get anything walked diner, I looked variety dishes patrons ordered felt slightly sick stomach. Must've inner conscious food bad news I guessed correctly. My brother Arcadian burger sunrise, stomach didn't settle well. Had desire eat throughout day. Trust eyes, nose, instinct. It's likely right.
Ritter's never fine dining establishment. It always diner. It always standby. It always home-cooked, open ready accept regardless time day day week. All truly required find one item menu really enjoy. For me, one item Grilled Chicken Breast Dinner. I almost always get item veggie day, sliced tomatoes sliced cucumbers. It always tastes good never breaks bank. Sometimes I might get breakfast, usually grilled chicken breast. Everyone try Ritter's least once. They accept cash, ATM present entry. Every then, I allow order slice freshly made banana cream pie. Wow...it tasty.
Coming west coast, probably worst sushi I long time. There descriptions rolls. They offer low sodium soy sauce. The wait 3 rolls 4 pieces sashimi took 25 minutes. Now food, scallop roll mushy ( scallops I wouldn't know). Actually, everything I ate mushy. The service inattentive. I waited 10 minutes refill iced tea, owner another server looked straight empty glass.
The food Ritter's tastes like I made home, endorsement. I feta tomato omelet, tasted skunked, like cooked dirty skillet. It's dirty diner meh food, open 24 hours. If you're drunk, I bet foood great.
This worst food I've ever had. If someone's idea nostalgia, nostalgia term I'd like forget, reality like nausea. Their greek soup (tasted like Campbell's chicken noodle flavored lemon) nasty lamb gyro douched cucumber dressing likely haunt long I live. For anyone looking good nostalgic diner experience, can't make recommendation I've yet experience one, least case, leave past belongs.
Your standard, no-frills diner. Open day err day, coming practically requirement night Walnut Street. Even daytime hours, I prefer Ritter's Pamela's. Ritter's spacious - matter time I show up, I've never wait. It's anything marvel at, it's diner food, you're getting exactly think. Their menu typical diner food, expansive - I little surprised see seafood options. Ultimately, I always come back corned beef hash. Exactly like canned corned beef hash every diner, that's exactly I'm looking for. I also occasionally order wings Ritter's makes way I prefer - freshly fried, naked, choice dipping sauce side. I've occasionally tried branch find dishes lacking. The meatloaf dry, lacking flavor, still heavy dish; burger even dryer served deconstructed - bad way. However, friends differing variants pancakes enjoyed them. Overall, cheap prices (yet cash only!), 24 hour convenience, rectifying late night munchies get Ritter's thumbs-up book.
People call "Critters" reason. The two times I've I unhappy. It's cheap, food also gross don't get much (thank goodness!). Very small toast, cold hard pancakes, adequate dippy eggs I received last time I went. Oh, cash too.
Ummm, we're pretty sure boyfriend got food poisoning here. That last thing eaten hours, next morning DEFINITELY eaten something bad waking up... yikes.
How place even stay business. It's disgusting. The food crap. Everything filthy. All waitresses look like crackheads. They screwed club sandwich & fries. How even possible? It deserves negative stars sucking badly.
We reservation evening. A group sat without reservation ahead us. We 10 minutes early....and unfortunately ignored door time walked in. No buzzer you. Afrer 15 minutes asked much longer told two minutes. Another 15 minutes went bye still standing without buzzer others sat. No apologies consideration given. We given years business always underwhelmed service. The sushi mediocre previously sushi bar South Hills. This loner case. I would implore try elae where. Jade Grill block away, completely new, goes way you. Next time try else. 0 5 I could
On postive note, honey dipped chicken dinner tasty well breakfast. However, meatloaf last night anything yummy. There seasoning I probably tasted one onion entire 2 thick slices. Greek lasagna made Easy Mac noodles + 1 lasagna noodle top. It also teeny tiny bit sauce. I'm sure Greek it. The rolls rock hard too. I'll come back Im drunk hungry greasy 3am breakfast burger appetizers since yelpers seemed say good things those. Also changed hours longer always 24 hours. Sunday, Monday & Tuesdays close ten.
We ordering food Little Tokyo almost 5 years now. Up last year I would rated 4 5 yelp scale. Over last 6 months I report lost edge. Their Maki Rolls consistently "sloppy" recently bones left eel roll. They also removed combo deluxe always enjoyed. We order least twice month I sorry write may looking new sushi place.
Food great; however, open 24/7. Huge disappointment. It late night, went thinking great restaurant open, found closed. Why would put huge sign saying restaurant open 24 hours, side says open 24 hours Wednesday, Thursday, Sunday, I went late night Sunday, closed? How confusing. It really difficult inform customer opening hours. Anyhow, I probably still go breakfast.
first date roll soy paper must also gotta try black marlin melts mouth
This Japanese food, period. Run Chinese folks serving glorified Chinese food.
Awful experience. We went Sunday afternoon. While waiting line, employee owner asked us (in rudest condescending manner possible) shut front door cold--despite fact ones holding open. When waitress took order, I asked hot turkey sandwich turkey, bacon, Swiss sandwich better. She looked I asked sold toilet brushes shrugging telling "they pretty popular." We ordered wings pierogies appetizers, waited 45 minutes. When boyfriend asked waitress food would coming soon, acted extremely annoyed, presence nuisance. She told us know food would "Sundays really busy." When pierogies came disappointed realize three came order. The wings dry. I decided hot turkey sandwich, little dry tasted okay overall. The bill $40, seemed exorbitant, especially light horrible service poor attitudes every employee encountered.
This place one couple open burgh 24 hours. That's automatic star dead city. They plenty food choices (hence star), food actually pretty terrible. The items good bacon toast.
Ritter's Diner Menu - http://imgur.com/a/ISC7b (They don't website menu online, I uploaded one imgur). I went Ritter's, nothing else put menu online everyone see. Yeah, place old outdated. My Order : Eggs/Sausage/Potatoes/Toast, Fried Chicken French Fries finally, Chili Cheese Fries. The good: - They parking, though lot bit odd. No parking = visit me. - The eggs pretty good. Can't say anything bad better eggs I had. - The potatoes/home fries also pretty good. - I really like consistency french fries. Their fries long taste good. - The breakfast prices reasonable. - They wide variety options menu. They seafood, burgers, hot dogs, chicken, steak, breakfast food, ice cream stuff. The bad: - It's 2015 website menu. Think that. I idea could ever find customers local area. They could put website free menu well. It would take less 1 day time. There's restaurants third world countries menu's online. - They want $1.75 cheese eggs. I almost buy full pack cheese price - The fried chicken so, want $7.70ish one chicken wing sized leg, mostly small breast even smaller leg. Not worth all, since get better deal Popeye's KFC, I find expensive. Their chicken better too. My friend got omelet sort seemed really like it. Would I return there? I could see returning quick breakfast while, I don't see going dinner. Recommendation: I can't say I recommend going way place. There's really nothing special it, wide variety options menu, parking breakfast prices reasonable. It's Peppermill(a chain diner restaurants west fabulous) though.
I'd like preface saying I one go way write negative review really easy please. Nevertheless... A us went late night bowling get food. We went Ritters literally place open within 5 mile radius starving. Anyways, made way past pack chain smoking waitresses front steps seated. Every surface place covered thin layer oily grime. It's clear cleanliness priority here. Your hand stick table touch it. And bathroom looks smells like something movie Saw. The waitstaff didn't even pretend friendly honestly looked like rolled halfway house. Also, frail, elderly waitress clearly extremely ill really shouldn't handling food. The food pretty terrible, it's diner option around midnight, whatever. We got bill proceeded counter pay. The little old white-haired curmudgeon I guess runs place shuffles counter, rips bill hand says "Give $28.38". I politely ask could pay separately (there four us). He grunts something inaudible sourpuss look face I ask repeat himself. He raises voice rudely says "Give $28.38. I don't time this, I'm busy". It 1:00 am, maybe 10 people entire place, sipping coffee counter. He could said "Sorry, don't split checks" would fine. No need nasty. He's like Soup Nazi Seinfeld nearly funny. You shouldn't mean condescending customers want return. I know neither I friends ever will.
Ritters I go diner food I don't want wait Pamela's it's off-hour time. Standard diner fare Greek twist. I much like stuffed grape leaves spinach feta omelette. I haven't sampled much else menu I'm vegetarian dinner options limited regard. On different note, I find diner atmosphere little depressing. The interior could use cleaning sprucing up. Additionally, several times I've table smelled strongly cleaning product, appetizing. I would really like give 3.5 stars, that's option.
I really late night keep mind Ritters located within walking distance bars Shadyside Bloomfield unfortunately it's place open 3am. As I times I would ever want to... If I blackout drunk cooking George foreman grill I could make better food... If like eggs served puddle miscellaneous kitchen liquid, bite chicken parm sandwich breading slip entire piece chicken place!!! Though I could list horror stories I experienced I concentrate one summarizes diner.... Friend orders milkshake... Only gets glass residual leftover mixing metal cup... He drinks rather quickly wonders leftover ever come... So waits waits keeps looking counter leftover bit sitting there... 45 minutes later waitress finally walks it, drops little bit icecream mixes it... Puts glass serves someone else. We called circle milkshake life...in every milkshake half old half new. People keep coming back perhaps like little nickel jukeboxes nothing else open , I even heard called Pittsburgh culinary institution... I'm sure brothers primanti, Pamela, delucas rolling graves... If Infact dead. What's sad though I downright disgusted place times,I know I return one drunken night ... Fml
Just writing it's funny time wasn't. Went Ritter's many times I Bloomfield. Once years ago breakfast sister, I went put sugar coffee sugar shaker plopped GIANT dried booger onto spoon. HA!!!! Ewwwww!
Terrible service. Decent pizza.
Horrible excuse slop house. DONT EAT HERE!! Food recooked disgusting. There many choices Pittsburgh area. Do NOT MAKE THE MISTAKE AND EAT HERE.
- Above average food - Below average prices - Spacious uncrowded - Free wifi - Cash
Overall: One Pittsburgh's better pies, definitely eating premise. Better service Aiellos, pie heavier, greasy, fresh. Come occasion, Aiellos wins across board. ____________________________________________ Ambience: (3/5). Dim lighting, dingy pizza parlor table-tops, framed accolades family photos turn pizza den. Crowded, booth-only dining area save stools island middle. The front counter kitchen, you'll leave smelling like pizza. ____________________________________________ Service: (3/5). Rushed pleasant. The 10+ people behind counter swap out, delivering pies taking orders. It's cafeteria style, vending machine included, give dirty tray. ____________________________________________ Drinks: (1/5). Soda, nothing special. Ice cream served next door. ____________________________________________ Food: (3/5). An experience excess, want grease cheese, it. The cheese thicker crust, slides least 50% time. 2-3 paper plates soaked end pepperoni.. spicy occasionally burnt. Crust thin absorbs large amount grease. The sauce occasionally burnt on, otherwise thin, thankfully salty. Pepperoni mushroom good bets here, onion sausage. You DO NOT need extra cheese.
The pizza amazing! Be careful ordering toppings usually cheese half half picky person may see toppings.
Cheese overload! I usually get extra cheese, decided time. It ended coming ton cheese. It made pizza heavy pick extra greasy. The topping slid off. I actually pick off. It bit favorite, would probably go back get light cheese next time.
Horrible. Tried several times. Taste like frozen Pizza. Found hair first time better judgement tried again. I swear worse first experience. The locals like joint must smoker destroyed taste buds.
My dad raves place always encourages stop in. I finally gave stopped one day way home studying Uptown. I ordered 2 slices pepperoni go less $5. I sad didn't actual pepperoni pie; slapped pepperoni plain slices tossed over. That's complaint. When I got home, I really excited get chewing. The bottom crust crunchy good (I couldn't eat end bits crust little hard). The pepperoni authentic, thick, spicy. The pizza super greasy cheesy, flavorful delicious. I trying I cash pocket.
Mineo's Pizza favorite pizza Pittsburgh region! So much family I make 30 mile journey location every week. Parking difficult, dining area could use TLC, unfortunately better carry cash form payment accept could expensive. They offer ATM forget. Minor unfortunates, however, pizza must try never it.
**Warning! A legend falls....New management, new pizza, family woke morning projectile emesis within 3 hrs eating calzone! I huge fan place since first calzone 1994. I haven't eaten since 2004 so, I going take GF sunday night nostalgia snacking. We took traditional go. I 1/2, 1/4 pcs, custom w/pizza let cats finger mushy dough sauce around 2am carpet picnics. We woke morning everyone house,( cats included!) projectile emesis! I would said, I deserved eating late, except cats sick too. So, looks like new management, cost cutting toppings dough w/sauce lost it's firmness quite unsatisfying, banal, common. I would recommend Aiolio's three doors up, unless they've changed too. I'm considering call health department. This unsat!
Mineo's used go pizza shop. But past several years, think pizza, think A'Pizza Badamo. I don't know Mineo's uses cheese, never fails cheese drops slice take bite. My kids cannot get eating slice without happening happens here. Mineo's needs desperately remodel shop love God, GET A CREDIT CARD READER. This 2016 1956. No one carries cash more. I hate make trip ATM get cash I get pizza. Clean place take debit card you're back list, though, it's road Badamo's.
I heard horrible things salon managed handle customer complaints. My dear friend right dealing owner salon. You would believe awful things said put through. This small community - really poor business skills treating people badly spreads like wildfire.
The southwest flatbread really bad sweet taste it, otherwise probably would alright. The chili soup wasn't hot. At least apple alright.
Went today lunch. I salad fuji apples & chicken. The salad good, I couldn't get past fact apples dried apple slices. Why can't Panera serve fresh apple slices? It's like apples impossible come ridiculously expensive February.
When I walked store I thought may going business. They ton display cases barely anything them. Weird. We tried cupcakes, cookies, loaf cinnamon bread, donuts. They fresh well prepared. The woman counter nice helpful, little awkward. I won't fault that. If filled cases maybe added decor place I might give 4, gives feeling could close anyday isn't worthy 4 stars. It average bakery I would give another try.
My husband I went today, picked goodies getting coffee Starbucks. (My husband LOVES bakeries always looking one go to.) Neither us cash us, (umm...sorry?) cashier rung us up, said, "Sorry, don't take cards unless spend least $10." The cupcakes everything else LOOKED good, alas, even one. We're going spend extra money meet quota. I guess we'll shop local, go Starbucks baked good on....or find one doesn't $10 minimum.
This crappy, dark theater leaks water rains. Do go!
Way worse I remember kid, probably I kid. The screens tiny women's restroom smelled stale piss. Two-thirds sinks non-functional least 2 stalls functional locks. The staff friendly, place old, run appearance little gross. At least feet didn't stick floor theater. It's movie theater. If already The Galleria want see movie willing pay theater prices place, it'll suffice. Odds are, you'd get better experience home.
Such shame. Terrific location, supported community awful. Filthy, bad seats, expensive others. Choose go elsewhere.
It's much improved recent renovation, cup holders now, although appear awkward location perhaps armrest backwards. Whatever, cup holders none, big improvement. My biggest gripe time around extreme volume *some* ads previews, I thought complaining, decided wait see whole movie going like this, commercial dilemma, turned be. It seriously loud. I'll continue come here, it's close house, I like selection movies show, I may wait find seat movie starts.
Located Galleria South Hills. Entrance inside Galleria. Recently remodeled. Huge seats comfort spacious lots room arms legs. Movie price outrageous opinion especially plan snacks. I would choose theater others area due recent remodeling.
Our experience didn't start well, girl counter couldn't pry texting long enough get tickets right, repeat 3 times. Then ordered snacks repeat order twice . Finally put phone retrieve items. $36 coke, nachos, 2 tickets seems bit steep especially considering theater dated, dirty smelled musty. Leg room great aside I can't think positive thing post. We won't return here.
The girl behind snack counter polite. I asked I could bring hot chocolate Panera. She said didn't care manager didn't care. I got hot chocolate I went give ticket manager, extremely smug rude. He looked like excited tell I couldn't bring drink in. I didn't care. I sat little snack area drank it. Just smugness tone attitude turn off. He interpersonal skills ever rude.
Overpriced snacks, sound movie awful. The movie quiet drama thunderstorm bass rumblings entire movie.
Why place always smell bad? Seriously, second walk door it's vaguely sewer-ish. Their roof deck okay, I honestly glad every establishment Lebo high-end, overall I'm fan.
As far atmosphere, The Saloon decent place. Earlier day, it's dead, low-key neighborhood vibe. In fact, it's low-key last time I in, essentially became family restaurant tables filling groups little kids parents I presume basketball game. Granted, forced us move, group adults didn't want spend afternoon attempting talk sounds dozen + kids, I guess video games one side bar, TV's, affordable food, it's awful option locals bring kids day. The bartenders always really nice, beer selection pretty good. With nice pint TV's, it's decent place catch game, definitely positive aspects The Saloon. Just don't expect much food. Now, yes...I'm fully aware it's bar, food isn't supposed great, food actually bad enough I'm hungry The Saloon isn't place I consider option unless we're meeting people there. I've given food menu three chances impress me, ordering different items time, sadly, food item I enjoyed complimentary popcorn brought table and/or gave us bar...and I'm big fan popcorn. Even something simple buffalo chicken tenders I ordered last time fail-safe hope meal - two previous disappointing experiences - scored below-average. The buffalo sauce almost gritty, seasoning sauce noticeable. Talk awful texture. The fries okay, sweet potato fries greasy. Now I'm sure people stand behind food The Saloon, 3 unimpressive meals, I know I'll hesitant next time I'm perusing menu visit. Perhaps I'll wise eat Aladdin's Little Tokyo next door The Saloon heading pub next time.
Bad food even bar beer prices bit much. This place nice layout, food worth money.
If close area simply want cheap beer friends cold night, go it. Just don't expect get anything else it. The bartenders pretty attentive make strong drinks I can't say food -- it's downright disgusting. The ambiance little strange. After sporting events, blast collection random music flow. The crowd consists mostly guys late 20s wear beanies fedoras like hunt crowd high school wolf packs cougars likely live area.
The service terrible. We 2 2 1/2 hours, weren't trying hang around watch Penguins game. The food solid, nothing more. The waitress really cute, that's positive thing I say place. I usually dig sports atmosphere, service really bad, I cannot stress enough.
If like greasy deep fried "food", nonchalant/terrible wait service smell stale beer head joint.. Two stars I say manager made solid attempt rectifying poor job server.
This place best draft beer selection far Mt. Lebanon menu decent bar food. Too bad bartenders slow wait staff few.
The Saloon, mediocre family restaurant 1980's surviving based locale alone. Somehow employees confused - claim it's nothing bar, excusing par service eh-okay food "bar", yet menu offers average family restaurant regular bar patrons Cali Europe find service frustrating offerings disappointing. The pricing high, even bar quality food service received. Sorry, sorry. This fact anyone regular place real bar, cheap pricing served alongside friendly cheers hearty meals reminiscent step-mother's microwave. The saloon posing, even family restaurant bar - would lamest bar college town matter, The Saloon like bar high schoolers sneak underage drinks. There bouncer cops duty, even though located across street, bar fights, - it's real bar. The Saloon know it's Pittsburgh, Irish, old guy's retirement fund. Severely stale popcorn served alongside poorly mixed drinks warm beers. Management absent, care absent, else - I coming back despite short distance. Just 10 minutes away Primanti Bros, I received lame service, warm beers, overpriced sandwiches made emotionally frustrated staff. $6.89 Primanti sandwich, well you'll paying dollars The Saloon along huff puff staff dim, lost souls local populace. Yuck. P.S. When see bad reviews Floridians posted below, know place bad news. When see positive reviews, think lost, drunk, staff - establishment worth two stars, even bar, keeps excusing as.
So place smoker friendly pub, located next Jernigan's Tobacco Village The Galleria. Looking pub, looks like olde English gentleman's study, I thought it'd fun go here. I also read article place sang it's praises. Don't bother eating here. I think one places sells food allow indoor smoking. Service (there ONE bartender working entire place) Is slow, food overpriced poorly made. I ordered described vegetarian sandwich, I got poorly made (and TINY) calzone.
At pub/restaurant side I bad experience, terrible food, even worse service. A complete waste money, avoid costs.
This place would nice theory except 2 important things. 1 service awful, 2 prices awful. There several places cigar smoker go much better service prices. Smoke cigar lounge collier, oyster house pleasant hills, castle tavern castle shannon, chippino strip,level 40 robinson etc.
Closed last Saturday... Sad see go. Even Website & Facebook pages say closed.
This place back open!!! According website looks like bought Puff-N-Stuff
We stopped lunch look around saw carry lot brands Nordstrom's. The store extremely pricey nothing really interested us. We interact staff since browsing. We spent 10 minutes left.
I've gone Rollier's lot years whenever I needed personal touch - something can't get places like Home Depot. Last week I went busted window screen frame. I wanted replace it, Rollier's built replacement screens past. For reason, time, MT plumbing determined repair frame instead sell new one. He told frame hardware actually thinner sell wouldn't fit. (Later I determined true - size.) He said instead could put brace across frame. OK I said. I'm always open saving $50+. Well brace added least 1/8" thickness frame. Now won't fit. If concerned new frame would fit, would think thick brace would? I remove brace get frame back window. So wasted time, probably 2 gallons $4/gallon gas, took $25.67 me. So much personal touch. I think I stick impersonal honesty Home Depot on.
If weren't all-fired expensive, I'd go Rollier's time. Their staff friendly knowledgeable, enough extra fun stuff (candy, Papyrus greeting cards, candles) almost feel like variety store, parking lot Washington definitely luxury! The main drawback prices high. I support much I can, purchases I afford spend little extra.
Imagine hardware stores see tv / movies go know get reliable help, well Rolliers place. The concept customer service expertise something past era. I dozen times reasons I never left disappointed. I walked door knob pieces 100 year old door - know exactly I looking for, dozens choose make sure I exact ones I needed. I could imagine look bewilderment I would get I walked big orange blue "home centers" questions. I gone back since continue go back I trust I told I ask questions - something hard find days. Yeah, items might little costly (not much experience) extra pays customer service don't get someplace concerned shareholder profits. I would rather pay little know I getting I need job first time rather wasting time again.
Convenient easier find items big box stores, although pay convenience. Most staff extremely knowledgeable helpful, others dire need customer service training (mocking eye rolling customers cool). Returns hassle including items sold defective missing parts.
This horrible experience. I ordered flowers Wednesday (on line) delivery Thursday. I received confirmation email. When I checked re-cypionate Thursday evening flowers delivered. I made numerous calls Mount Lebanon floral shop, different story time: never received order told I call Teleflora, received went delivery never got delivered, never got order, final excuse got order canceled didn't deliver suburb Pittsburgh!? Yet time could call suggest I order another shop. I extremely disappointed never order recommend anything!?
I tried Marks close house. I found inconvenient hours, slow service, people terribly friendly knowledgeable. When I (politely) pointed I got something similar significantly lower cost long ago, blushingly knocked quite dollars price--then presented jewelry uncleaned covered blue felt. And send away box even felt jewelry bag, cheap net star *candy* bag eBay. I using true jewelers going forward.
Boring pretentious mall old dated stores
I think A-Ok good way put mall. I also add didn't get venture around I Painting Twist. After eating dinner enough time head painting class. As stores, walked Anthropologie, Ann Taylor toy store (Learning Express) Obviously there's I one floor. For eating there's full sized Panera Bread inside, Chinese spot Starbucks Houlihans, Mitchell's Fish Market example. A BRGR coming soon!! I would've given 4 stars ahh parking!! The top lot full Saturday afternoon given small number stores inside.. go lower level lot.. still impossible find spot! We ended seeing couple leaving patiently waited leave take spot. No parking available upper lower level. If going lower level, sure white knuckle larger vehicle "hill/road" go narrow. Add bend well it's weird.
Pittsburgh Restoration Hardware worst customer service ..stay away.
The management team mall would get negative stars possible. A weeks ago I wrote email famous tyrant herself, mall manager Gina course got response. I proceeded email various people parent company still...no response. Here's skinny: A weeks ago I coffee outside Starbucks patio mom spin class 3 people sat bench front mall near Starbucks patio began smoking. The disgusting smell carcinogens inhaling made us physically ill left I wrote email Gina. She didn't respond I hopeful would someone policing smoking enforcing rules given email...I known better. The next week went back 3 us total guess what? Same thing time chef Houlihan's also front smoking... Nice right? This offensive me, set health aside...how kids, babies pregnant women walk smoke cloud walk front door mall? What mothers try sit patio Starbucks forced leave health children? Until issue fixed Gina fired get real manager knows they're I boycotting sad little mall. There's really good stores anyway besides Williams Sonoma Restoration Hardware I'll shop online go Ross Park I need something. I'm also going complain Starbucks corporate Houlihan's corporate I hard time believing want people see chef going preparing food smoking front. Avoid place hopefully together institute change better health us all.
I bought mattress Mattress World great got money. I still fighting delivery. They never called schedule time delivery day set up. Then figure coming, I call store 5 times. After getting "window" never showed up. No call, nothing. I sat around entire saturday waiting one ever called me. I calling got shoved around person person without straight answer bed was. We get old bed back people gave didn't sleep floor. It horrible. Then, I tried set delivery date promised specific time, window. They also promised partial refund massive inconvenience. Not late delivery, I yet see money. NEVER AGAIN. They horrible, rude, unhelpful I would never recommend anyone use them. I refused delivery got money back.
I recently relocated Pittsburgh looking nice, reasonably priced mattress. A friend recommended place me, I pleased salespeople quality mattress purchased. My issues began delivery: drivers rude refused bring box spring upstairs, saying 'it would fit'. After I explained them, that, fact would (the previous renter full-size box spring apartment, I purchased), flat refused even try bring upstairs! I asked three times please try refused three times. I asked take box spring basement, point pouted rolled eyes - even though 8 steps basement. I called Mattress World complain, thing offered refund half delivery fee (yes, half!) I asked could please send another set drivers out. They told would see could I never heard back them. If going shop here, use delivery service. And issues, expect customer service purchase either.

Worst experience hairdresser ever, location. Made appointment Diane body wave. When I sort greeted looked hair said "You get body waves?" Yeah, that's I booked one salon. Then argued trim, I wanted wanted before, five minutes acknowledged didn't matter, FIRST telling perm "wouldn't soak in" ends unless trimmed it. Then argued rods. It's taken ten years figure Aveda perm hairstylists perfect combo is. Diane knew better, finally agreed. Then proceeded comb wet hair, forehead back, scratching scalp jerking head. That wasn't enough, though. She started rolling rods thought I have. I got left. When I addressed problem front, NO EFFORT WAS MADE TO HELP offer coming back talking owner. Yeah. Right. THAT'S gonna happen. Horrible salon...dirty, also, side note.
La Pomponnee, I wanted like you. I really did. I've gone 5 times various services, time hoped get I felt I paying for, always left rejected. Literally. The staff La Pomp AWFUL! Many rude act like hindrance day even though job. I heard staff gossiping - sometimes even customers - multiple occasions. And I've hair done salon, I left middle hair cut stylist attend someone else, I sit hair dripping. The one thing (and get 2 stars instead 1), DO tend good job hair. The massage I got so-so, expensive, ended sales pitch - relaxing. But hair, do. I can't make worth time, it's expensive I feel I'm kicked door staff talk crap I'm gone. I million different spas years (I facial whore!). Maybe spas Pittsburgh aren't par one's I've gotten used San Diego. But La Pomponnee good spa experience massages hair styling. I'll going Stonewater on.
I went first time recommendation. I request specific stylist, told I could appointment "any time week." I received decent cut, left promising receptionist I would NEVER return. Online, women's haircut price quoted $30+. I get basic cut, I expected $30, $35 most. Only I checked I informed cut actually $44. When I asked cost much higher base quote, receptionist told cost based experience stylist. My stylist -- one chosen WITHOUT revealing policy -- working salon 13 years. I understand unit commensuration -- although, I think it's bad business insinuates customer receive much lower quality experience stylist younger. However, salon policy, one CLEARLY stated upon scheduling appointment. From perspective, La Pomponnee preyed upon naivety (seemingly deliberately) chose expensive stylist. This downright terrible customer service, reason eliminated chance long-term relationship.
The worst salon experience LIFE. I long dark hair I dying burgundy home. I wanted try blonde first time. I consultation appointment Elizabeth - purpose & I would page. I wanted gradually lighten hair start using color remover first bleach. She said sure, problem, first visit would take 2.5 hours. She came across extremely rude, stuck up, & friendly all. I gave benefit doubt & I completely regret it. The first visit took almost SEVEN hours, 2.5. She didn't care I wanted put like 10 lbs foil hair even though I NEVER SAID I WANTED HIGHLIGHTS & reference photo I showed ZERO highlights. I trusted her, I thought, "maybe get hair blonde." NOPE. Because used foils instead painting product directly hair, right side head bleach 45 minutes longer left side head! The end result? My hair 20 different colors! I parts almost white, parts ORANGE, parts brown, others almost black. It looked HORRIBLE. It looked like someone would home go salon asking fix! I idea problem was, made hair look AWFUL. I felt sick stomach I saw hair, worst part? She left 1-2 inches naturally BLACK roots! WHY??? She tried fix mistake MORE foils MORE bleach, processed hair, causing lasting damage. She extremely rough head scalp, yanking & pulling head, snapping hair, even though NO BLEACH TOUCHED MY SCALP, head extremely sore 3 days afterwards! I felt horrible. I went look prettier. Instead, I left UGLIEST hair entire life. I told I wanted GRADUALLY lighten hair, & I expected light brown first session. I NOT expect 20 different ugly colors hair. I cried night embarrassed I wouldn't leave house without hat. Elizabeth almost 20 years I THOUGHT would good job. She's either incompetent ruined hair purpose. I go different salon Squirrel Hill pay 500+ dollars fix ELIZABETH did. She damaged hair badly I ended 8 inches cut off. I grew hair 2 years this, really upsetting lose 8 inches hair mistake. The good thing refunded money, really I feel like paid fixed since they're responsible damage first place! The owner second salon I went made hair pretty again. It beautiful blonde, really short, & real damage done hair caused HIGHLIGHTS ELIZABETH did. I 100% regret going La Pomp. La Pomp HORRIBLE, AWFUL. I would give ZERO stars option.
This place SUCKS. The pharmacist assistants EXTREMELY condescending prejudiced older people. My sister's friend treated extremely horribly people never apologized, said "we get lot elderly people often lose patience." They still apologized lost insurance card. If want treated respect competent, respectful service, DO NOT get prescriptions here.
When I younger, friend I went CVS started interviewing strangers camera. ("Have ever Alaska?" "What color socks?") We used spray BOD around. We painted blue head toe acted casually. We terrors. They put us, I loyal customer return. I've never bad experience. I live close, I roll whenever I want new nail polish color. As d

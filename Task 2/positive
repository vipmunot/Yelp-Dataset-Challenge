The fact boyfriend I refer "shady Giant Eagle" pretty good indication I feel place. In times desperation, I'll stop in, head straight items I need, make quick exit. Besides eyesore, employees I've dealt seem slightly clueless, causing lines move slowly. The customers don't make experience better. I remember standing behind woman line arguing cashier 10 minutes charged 2 cents price tag. Yes, that's right. 2 CENTS. It took lot deep breaths restrain throwing loose change storming out.
